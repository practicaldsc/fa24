0,klm-royal-dutch-airlines,A Sahni,2015-07-24,"KLM Business Class from Barcelona via AMS to DFW. Early morning flight started with KLM from Barcelona at 7.00am, Boarding was simple with two lines one for Business class other for economy. Once on the plane and departed morning service began with breakfast followed by coffee and juices. Food good and fresh compared to US carriers where the breakfast is usual not good. Amsterdam airport great undergoing a renovation at some parts. Lounge massive with two food area's and a huge selection of food for breakfast with good selection of liquor, and beer if wanted and coffee/soda/juices. KLM flight from AMS to DFW on the Airbus 330-200 seat old business class seats but the recline was enough for a day flight to DFW of nine hours. Service onboard was great food much better compared to US carriers along with dessert though KLM lacks in drinks offers with a limited selection of mainly wine and beer. Overall KLM has really good service in Business class, and once the A330 aircraft get the new business class seat the product offered will on par with others.",Business,8
1,hawaiian-airlines,Peter Pomeranze,2015-07-27,"Flying Hawaiians seasonal non stop was a pleasure. Comfortable seating, warm service and good food were the highlights of a pleasant comfortable experience. Nothing to add but a hearty recommendation. I actually prefer the older 767s over the newer A330's. Even the luggage was delivered in a timely manner.",First,8
2,tap-portugal,David Olvierk,2015-07-21," I fly up to Lisbon on a near weekly basis generally on  Lufthansa. When there are no seats left I'm force to book with TAP. I'm continuously disappointed and frustrated with TAP, last year I missed my wedding anniversary dinner when I took the mid-afternoon flight home. At Lisbon and with 10 minutes to go before scheduled boarding were suddenly told there was a 6 hour delay! If they'd told us earlier I'd have got another airline and made the dinner. When I wrote a constructive letter to TAP the Costumer service replied saying she was unable to 'communicate' reasons for delays. Second attempt, an automatic reply, until today no one reply on a proper way to my complain. Once again I was forced to fly TAP for the first time in a year and I got a 2 hours delayed flight, this is shocking. Once again why or why are they so dreadfully poor on punctuality! The snack they offered on board was worst since last time. Shocking airline which does not seem to be improving. By the way in 3 years on Lufthansa I have been delayed once for 20 minutes.",Economy,1
3,spirit-airlines,Narges Noori,2015-06-22,I've been using Spirit for 2years because my husband lives in Chicago and I am a student in Minneapolis. At the beginning Spirit airlines had the best prices: $60 roundtrip and they were usually on time. For about 4 month their prices went up (more than other airlines). Worse than that is the fact they frequently cancel their flight with the excuse that the weather is not good but no other airlines cancel their flight! This is the last time I used them. I feel bad because I think they are assuming that the consumers are stupid. ,Economy,1
4,precision,Joe Rossi,2015-07-17,"Dar Es Salaam to Arusha. One day delay, landing to wrong airport, no taxi or bus paid to go to the planned airport, no baggage (still at Dar Es Salaam). No information from staff, and at leasst 2 days safari have been lost without any compensation. Same problem with the return from Arusha to Zanzibar : another airport to take off, no buses, compensation etc. Fly with this company at your own risk !",Economy,1
5,klm-royal-dutch-airlines,Jeff Evans,2015-07-13,"A mixed performance by KLM. Arrived at Heathrow for a connecting flight to Amsterdam. Although checked in, there were clearly inadequate number of check in staff at Heathrow - just three dealing with KLM and Air France flights. A lot of passengers were travelling in groups and had a lot of luggage. The queuing times were excessive - was just glad I arrived early. Others had to jump the queue because their flights were due to depart in 30 minutes. The aircraft left late and there were operational problems with loading luggage at Heathrow. This meant the connection time at Amsterdam was very tight. However, it was a different story between Amsterdam and Tokyo with an excellent crew, One stewardess, in particular, went out of her way to provide me with refreshments throughout the flight - and this was economy!",Economy,7
6,thomas-cook-airlines,Sian Booth,2015-07-21,Just would like to say that myself and family (four adults) flew with Thomas Cook premium economy from Manchester to New York and back. I think it was excellent value for money. Staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful. The food was excellent and there was a good choice of films. Blankets and pillows provided - great for night flight. ,Economy,10
7,tam-airlines,A Barros,2015-07-14,"Flight JJ8020 from Rio de Janeiro to Santiago. To call it a business class is a gross exaggeration. To begin with, with a flight departure at 07.04am, the lounge was not open until 06.15 when they began boarding for the flight. On board, no welcome drink, a broken seat (luckily the seat next to mine was available, so I could move) and a cabin crew that were more interested to talk to each other than to welcome boarding passengers. After take-off, again the cabin crew spent most of their time closing the curtain between the business class and the galley. Breakfast was reasonable and had a choice of a platter of cold cuts and a hot omelette. After that, no more spontaneous drink service for a 4.5 hour flight. Selection of the press very poor and no individual entertainment system. The aircraft was old and looked and felt old. Very indifferent service.",Business,2
8,kuwait-airways,Sreekanth nallamalli,2015-06-14,"The flight was good but was outdated, the entertainment system was not working in some seats. The food was great and the crew friendly. It was good value for money.",Economy,7
9,alitalia,Lindsay Eandres,2015-06-26,"The cabin was staffed with quite a few FAs and we were told that the F&B manager was on board making sure that the service was up to standard for their new something or other ... it was a long spiel. Cabin seemed new, leather and seats reclined nearly but not completely flat. Food was a disaster and my expectations had been raised by the greeting. I ordered the veal (a mistake) and it was tough as I expected but the sauce that was on it was so salty that it was inedible. My traveling partner did not eat as he was asleep. When I asked for something else, I was told that only pre-made cheese plates were left and they all have blue cheese on them to which I am allergic. After that, it seemed that everyone was busy and no beverages or anything else was offered for the remaining four hours of the flight. When the plane was landing, I was asked for feedback and I said that I was hungry since they had no other food. The FA said they did have more food, and offered me something but at that point the trays had to be stowed, etc. I am not sure why this was handled so poorly, I was polite and understand that the crew does not make the food. Even some bread or any other option would have been appreciated and since the person I traveled with did not eat and some seats were empty, it seems odd that they thought they ran out of all other food options.",Business,1
10,american-airlines,Roger Hanson,2015-07-06,"Flight cancelled from JFK to Cancun. I have had mobile app downloaded from American Airline's website that told me all the time the flight was on schedule. Arrived at airport to see on the boards that flight cancelled. Directed to counters to deal with and maybe try and book next flight. No apology, staff were unhelpful and counter staff downright ""offish"" to the situation. I was even told the mobile app doesn't communicate with flight counter so its information can be incorrect. So the question is what's the point of the app if doesn't provide up-to-date info. Flight booked for next day. So we incurred cost of overnight near JFK and incurred cost of night at destination. No offer to assist with accommodation for overnight caused by the cancellation. We were made to feel as if we as the customer was an intrusion to the non-operation of this flight. I lost my confidence with the airline, and return flight from Cancun to Dallas, the flight was delayed by almost three hours. So we had cancelled flight, then our scheduled return flight to connect with another international flight was delayed by hours.",Economy,1
11,emirates,A Lee,2015-07-02,"While I did get my value for money, I wouldn't consider flying Emirates again. Ground service at Sydney airport was ok. Check-in was quick and smooth. However, at the gate staff were generally unfriendly and quick to dismiss people. The person managing the gate seemed tired and angry at customers. The plane was clean and quite spacious. The seats were comfortable and the inflight entertainment was very good. There was a very large selection of entertainment. However, the flight was significantly let down by the crew. When boarding, the flight attendant at the door sent me down the wrong aisle. When serving the hot towels, the flight attendant literally threw a towel at me. During the meal service, the flight attendant gave me the wrong order. Instead, she gave me my seatmate's order (and gave my seatmate my order). Additionally during the drinks service, the flight attendant seem bothered when I asked what tea they were offering. Ultimately I thought the crew were inexperienced, tired and annoyed. This was my first flight with Emirates, and it unfortunately has given me a bad impressions of the airline.",Economy,5
12,qatar-airways,Brian McCaig,2015-07-13,"A few years ago, I took advantage of a special offer from London with Qatar Airways in economy class, and was impressed with the standards of service then. Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection. I would thoroughly recommend Qatar Airways and it will be my airline of choice for future trips, even though Glasgow airport is more convenient for me.",Business,10
13,sas-scandinavian-airlines,Johan Johnsson,2015-06-26,"I was pleasantly surprised by the refurbished cabin. Changed from a 2-2-2 seat configuration in Business class to a 1-2-1 configuration, SAS has taken a huge leap forward in terms of the product for premium passengers. Seats now full flat, all with aisle access. Excellent service with a great variety of food. Breakfast had a very good choice of options. The new cabin lighting offers a special feeling. Free wifi works but can be slow sometimes. When all their long haul fleet is renovated (at present A330's have been refurbished) SAS will offer a very competitive product on their intercontinental routes. ",Business,10
14,bangkok-airways,Nuti Damrongphatr,2015-07-01,"Check in very quick with no queue. Business Class lounge I am eligible to use is recently renovated and very comfortable, lots of food (including hot food and light snack) and drinks. Onboard with friendly flight attendants, tasty hot snack served with juice and coffee/ tea. The aircraft looks a bit old, but the seat is new slimline version and give a decent seat pitch. Although it is not really comfortable ergonomic-wise, extra space provided is appreciated. Returning on PG-278, lounge in Phuket is too crowded and too warm, same aircraft as the outbound flight, light dinner is served and it is really enjoyable, both in taste and portion. Their staffs are good as always.",Economy,9
15,thomson-airways,B Reardon,2015-07-25,This is not my first Dreamliner flight however I am at a loss with the hype. Seat pitch is great and previously the inflight entertainment was however not on the June 15. Food OK however biggest gripe was only 2 drinks run for a 12.5hours flight and had I not taken my own drinks I would have been dehydrated. Every visit to the galley staff were on a break and drinks not available or a promise they would be around in 10 mins however they weren't.,Economy,3
16,qatar-airways,CB Enslin,2015-07-05,"Effective check-in and transferring. Cabin crew attentive and friendly. Very limited legroom, making the flight really uncomfortable when the flight is full as was the case on the BCN-DOH leg. I am a regular flyer and have found the legroom on all four flights to be exceptionally limited compared to other airlines. Serving of meals on the first two legs seemed disorganized. I was served my meal only two hours after the meal service started. On the second leg I received my meal relatively quickly, but the passengers sitting five rows ahead of me were only served about an hour later. I could not figure out the logic. Serving of meals on the return flights were well organized though.",Economy,7

Rest I flew Economy. Flight Hannover-Munich short 45 min service with full bar and muesli service. Munich is a great airport to transfer! Lufthansa offers all passgengers free coffee/cappuccion/tea from machines and free newspapers at the gates. Flight Munich-Istanbul also with new onboard connect wireless entertainment system on short/medium haul routes which is a massive improvment. You can use your tablet or notebook and have access to a variety of movies in different languages, music, flight map and: newspapers and magazines in different languages from the same day to download.

18,el-al-israel-airlines,Paul Suliteanu,2015-06-11,"TLV-OTP-TLV. Outbound Boeing 737-900ER, brand new aircraft with sky interior and slim new seats. Very good entertainment, overhead LCD with TV shows. Food very good some chicken tapas, tahini hummus, pita salad and chocolate mousse. Crew young, smiling and friendly. Got delayed for 2 hours because of some closed routes but kept informing us so no problem. Boarding done quickly and right after takeoff so no waiting on aircraft. Inbound Boeing 737-800. Left before time and upgraded to preferred seat for $50, great seat near window emergency exit with a lot of space, also middle seat empty so felt like European business on other airlines. Again overhead entertainment on LCD screen. Didn't eat but choice was tapas - either tuna or chicken. Given 2 cans of cola and fanta. Crew friendly and young purser was very funny. Captains update on route weather and procedures very nice. Will fly again, definitely improved and with new aircraft cheaper and better than competitors.",Economy,9
19,aer-lingus,Allison Garetto ,2015-07-20,"The flight attendants were very rude, and the media system was broken which didn't help an 8 hour flight. Kept asking for updates about it and the flight attendants didn't acknowledge it. They only came around with drinks once. Food was inedible, and the leg room was small even for an airplane. I've flown internationally many times before and Aer Lingus was the worst in my opinion.",Economy,1
20,british-airways,Richard Dalgleish,2015-07-14,"BA is getting more like a budget airline every time I fly. I now have to pay £15 to choose a seat when I book in and then wait an unreasonable time to board. Fast track were called forward first and about 80% of the passengers went that way. When I finally got to the front I asked if all the fast track were fast track and was told ""no but we are not allowed to make them go to the general boarding queue"" so what is the point. Easyjet and Norwegian are far better than BA for short haul and any Middle East airline for long haul. Try harder BA please!",Economy,3
21,austrian-airlines,M Studzinski,2015-07-06,"New T2 Terminal in London, Business Class check-in due to Star Gold status. Excellent Lufthansa lounge with excellent selection of food and drinks. Long way to the gate, flight delayed for 45 mins, but we managed to land almost on time in Vienna. A321 used on both flights is very nice plane and legroom was ok. Food only consisted of a small bag of snacks/pretzels and drinks, served by bored-looking and not too friendly FAs. I havent heard ""please"" or ""you're welcome"" once. Transfer in Vienna was ok, Austrian Terminal is new but not interesting, just a long grey corridor with gates and few shops - boring. Very nice lounge in VIE, good food and beverage selection. In Sofia my suitcase arrived as a last one, despite being tagged as a Priority. Shame. Both flights just correct, nothing to remember.",Economy,3
22,american-airlines,Jill Halligan,2015-07-31,"We flew from Boston, MA to St. Thomas U.S.V.I. on July 14th 2015. Flight #1619 from Boston to Miami was our first leg of the trip and that went smoothly. Then we got onto flight #2421 from Miami to St. Thomas. It was delayed a half hour. We landed in St. Thomas still being able to make our ferry to Tortola. However, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for all of our luggage to be deplaned. During this time three other planes landed, all of their luggage was sorted out and the passengers from those planes left the terminal. We found one of our pieces of luggage was still in Miami. Our flight came in at 3.30pm, originally supposed to land at 2.57pm. It is well know that ferries stop running from Charlotte Amalie at 4.30pm. American should have done everything in its power to get people on their way. At least one third of the passengers were in the same situation as us. Four others lost baggage. My son spent the next morning trying to reconnect with his luggage and were told we would have to make a trip to the ferry terminal to pick it up. Now on to our flight home, July 25th 2015, we arrive at the airport three hours before our flight. The six of us were flying from St. Thomas to Philadelphia, PA on flight 837 leaving at 3.05pm. We arrived at the airport at 11.45am. We went to the kiosk and got our plane tickets and then joined the extremely long line (1.5 hours), at the ticket counter, just to get our luggage tags.",Economy,3
23,xl-airways-france,Christine Gayle,2015-07-29,"This was the least expensive flight I saw advertised and was not as bad as some reviews had made me fear. The legroom is scarce for a taller person (I am 5 foot 9) and it seemed that this flight was slightly longer than it actually was. The food was average, but, given the price, I cannot say I won't fly this airline again.",Economy,5
24,vueling-airlines,S Becker,2015-07-24,"I have taken this airline twice. Both times it has be over 2 hours delayed.

27,united-airlines,Brandi Porter,2015-07-29,"Everytime I fly with this airline there is a 3 or more hour delay due to ""awaiting aircraft."" One time is was because the pilot was in a different city and had to get to Boston to fly out, which took 5 hours! Another time the plane was awaiting the crew which was coming from a different city apparently. Then the plane was just delayed leaving its first departure city and we were never told why just that as soon as it gets in we would be on our way. This is just ridiculous. First off I had a connection flight and was not notified of the delay. Secondly, they had no one at the desk to assist customers trying to find a new flight and when I finally found someone at a different gate, who was semi helpful, she informed me that the next flight out would be 15 mins before my new scheduled departure time. So in my experience this airline is all about delays if your current flight is coming from another city. I get it, things happen but this airline really needs to improve its punctuality. I only took this flight this time beacuse of my miles and I was disappointed again.",First,1
28,cathay-pacific-airways,E Carew,2015-07-02,"The flight departed late as the incoming arrival from HKG was late. The staff were indifferent: few similes, unlike on Philippine or Singapore Airlines, or Cebu Pacific, where looking passengers in the eye and smiling are the order of the day. The flight was also close to full so there was little chance of having an empty seat next to a traveller. The baggage allowance for check in is only 20 kilograms: on some other airlines, it is 23 or even 30kg. Overall not particularly impressive and a case of living on their laurels. The inflight entertainment lacked a 'hits and memories of the 60s, 70s and 80s' channel.",Economy,4
29,southwest-airlines,Jeff Bradley,2015-06-14,"My friend and I flew Southwest from DAY-TPA on June 6 with a return flight June 10. The outbound aircraft was one of the old Air Tran 737s, a little frayed around the edges, but perfectly servicable. The return flight was on a newer 737-700, everything was new and bright. Both aircraft were clean, and staff was friendly, professional, and courteous. My only complaint was that the seats seemed a bit narrow and I am not a big guy. The outbound flight was on time, while the return flight was delayed three hours by a thunderstorm over the airport. This was my first time flying Southwest and I will definitely be flying them again.",Economy,8
30,japan-airlines,L Alvin,2015-07-03,"Was actually a domestic plus a international flight. Upgraded the domestic ones to Class J (Note: they never mentioned it was business class, and neither did I think it was business class). Domestic: No food, just drinks on board. pretty decent and Class J seats were nice. Staff were tentative and smiling. No complaints at all. International: NRT-SIN-HND (JL711, JL038). Both were good. I ordered the gluten free meal and got exactly what I wanted. Staff were nice, boarding was efficient, and never a minute late. Only thing to say is the IFE, low selection of movies as well as songs (can't blame them as Japan is almost half a decade slow in releasing movies). Food was good. Best parts of JAL: Great Economy seats, and marvellous punctuality. If you are looking to get in for a transfer with only 1.5 hours for transit, this is the airline to take. ",Business,10
31,klm-royal-dutch-airlines,Aaron Gourley,2015-07-05,"The ground crew were polite, professional, and cared about trying to make us happy. We had a baby, so we had to go to the transfers desk to print our boarding passes. They helped us bypass long lines so that we could make our connection on time. Because we were boarding from a connecting flight we weren't able to arrive early enough to claim the bassinet seating (there were lots of babies on the plane) but the flight hostess was able to find another seat for the woman sitting beside my wife, so we had a place to put out 6 month old instead of holding him the whole time. The plane was clean and comfortable, and the food was acceptably good for airplane food. The hostesses were very friendly, professional and presentable. I would recommend this airline.",Economy,9
32,american-airlines,Beth Kutcher,2015-07-25,"American is usually okay for me but they aggravated me this time around. I'm assuming the airlines set the flight times. We had a 2 hour layover which is usually enough time but due to the size and unecessary complexity  I already reviewed the airport separately) of Miami airport, it was not enough time and we had to run to make final boarding call. I feel like an airline should understand times and how each airport is and should not schedule flights if they know it will be almost impossible for their customers. We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo. Some smaller complaints: they did not serve snacks on any of their flights for this trip and they did not show any good entertainment. They kept showing show after show instead of movies and not any good shows either that are popular.",Economy,3

40,british-airways,John Duffus,2015-06-28,"Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems. 100 minutes prior to departure, 2 check in desks were open - 1 business, 1 economy. As a BA Silver card holder, I joined the business queue. First one lady had considerably too much baggage. The arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. Then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. Not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight, others were way too large. After 20 more minutes I asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. This was not possible, I was told. Eventually another economy desk opened; yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. Finally after more than 40 minutes, someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all! Looking forward to a drink in the lounge, I then discover there is no lounge airside. As for the LHR-ORD flight, I have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. To board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31"" was a major shock. This is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. The worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. The meal was OK and the IFE had a decent selection of movies. But overall, the flight was hugely uncomfortable. With some other carriers still offering a seat pitch greater than 31"", BA has lost my future business.",Economy,2

This time, my flight left an hour late because of AC issues. When we land in Dallas for my transfer, I went from a 45 minute layover, to run as fast as I could to catch my gate.

This made the flights no cheaper than the ones that other airlines offered. The cabin - despite pictures on the internet - looked gloomy, old fashioned and dirty.

Horrified to find on boarding that BA have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch - exactly the same as in economy. The presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation. Fortunately this was a short flight but even so I was extremely uncomfortable. Cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly BA don't care. I sometimes go to Cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr+ flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally. The meal was passable but as the flight took off a couple of minutes before midday it was classed as ""late breakfast"" and no wine was served.

While three of these flights varied from acceptable to quite good, the final leg from Hong Kong back to Singapore was awful. Having arrived late (see below) from London, we boarded yet another delayed flight only to find that, without any prior notification to us, they had switched the aircraft from the one on which we had booked our seats to one with the old A330 series 2-3-2 Business Class configuration. Not only is this more like sitting in Premium Economy, my wife and I were now separated by a passenger in the centre seat between us, with whom we had to negotiate a swap. With the flight already twenty minutes late, it was then announced that we had to wait for connecting passengers from yet another delayed Cathay flight, and we eventually pushed back from the gate 50 minutes late. Once airborne things didn't improve. While the crew were courteous enough, the food was an absolute disgrace for Business Class. We both had to send our dried-out, tough and tasteless fish entrees back, and the replacement noodles had all the attributes of a convenience store offering. The toilets, which began the flight having seen better days, were filthy by the end of it, with discarded paper overflowing from the rubbish bin and the floor wet. I will avoid flying Cathay Pacific in future for fear of encountering another flight like this one. It's a shame, because their new Business seat is actually very well thought out, and the touch-screen entertainment system excellent. But for me there's just too much risk of delays, poor food, and encountering the outdated 2-3-2 Business Class cabin to warrant the asking price. Out of our four sectors, push-back from the gate was delayed on three of them by 60, 40 and 50 minutes respectively.

I couldn't believe that as we had previously flown in much worse weather. It wasn't even raining but I won't argue with the decision Air China made as safety is a priority. We were already so tired and we weren't happy as our return flight to Korea with Air China had already been rescheduled inconveniently. It was very hard to access to the wifi at the airport so It was very difficult to change our pick up arrangements to accommodate the late arrival in Paris. I asked the Air China Duty manager at the check in desk to let us stay at the hourly hotel in the airport for a couple of hours as we were tired and a shower was needed considering the humid Beijing weather. I am very unhappy with how we were dealt with. One of the duty managers told us he understood how annoying the situation was for us. Furthermore, He said he would do anything he could for us so I requested the hourly hotel and he made a phone call. After he was on the phone for a short time he said, unfortunately, there were no rooms available . As much as we were frustrated and annoyed, I thought he couldn't really do anything more for us at that time. I asked him if he could put us on the waiting list for a room at least, so if any rooms became available we could get one. He said that wasn't a problem and he said our names were on the list. Although we were tired and frustrated we had no idea he was lying to us so we were quite polite and cooperative, I wish I grabbed his name at that time as we later discovered almost everything he told us was a lie. After we went through customs and security we headed to the hourly hotel as I wanted to double-check our names were actually on the waiting list. They informed us that there was no list as they had plenty of rooms available for us if we were willing to pay. We explained to the hotel attendant what we had been told and his response was that Air China said they were not willing to pay for it. With the help of the hotel attendant we tried to call the Air China Duty Manager but of course he wouldn't answer the phone. I also called the customer service desk of Air china and finally got through to somebody after several attempts and considerable time on hold. The lady told me that she couldn't help because I chose English therefore the line went through to LA Air China so that she couldn't help us. I don't know where to begin to complain about this situation. The way we were dealt with is totally unacceptable. First of all, how the manager lied to our faces like that I still can not believe he thinks he can do that to customers. I have never seen anyone so unprofessional and dishonest when representing a big company. If customer service is only for Chinese speaking people and English speakers only get a dummy speaker and they can't actually help anyone with the problems, they might as well be up front about it.

The lady in the window seat also had trouble with her seat. The food was not that great. The cabin staff were fine but not anything special like Emirates.

These are an improvement over the older angled seats but they are inferior to pods found on other carriers. In the fully flat position there is little space for your feet and overall, the seat is narrow. Flight left late due to congestion at FRA and arrived slightly behind schedule. The service was fairly attentive with FA's smiling throughout the flight. The appetizer was delicious but my lunch selection was overcooked and was quite bland. There were a wide selection of spirits and drinks to choose from and the wines served were fairly good. Pre-arrival meal was tasty and the portions were quite big. The IFE had a poor selection of movies and lacked in the number of new releases for both movies and music although the Bose noise-cancelling headphones were a nice touch.

92,emirates,Joern Sauer,2015-07-10,"Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",Economy,1

Having decided which movie to watch after lunch, not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787's IFE system - even 8 days after the start of the month. I then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. These are distinctly second rate in terms of choice - and not all are classical. IFE is one area where QR can definitely improve. Prior to take off on the second flight from Doha to BKK the FA asked about meal choices, reminding me the meal would served on demand as is QR's custom. I made it very clear I wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice, coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. We agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. I was then awakened, raised my chair, threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. The first comment was ""we are arriving early!"" which was not true. The second was that it was assumed I would need time to freshen up! Both inexcusable! On going to the aft toilet to change, the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. Then on asking for the complex landing cards required in Bangkok, I was informed they had not been loaded at Doha since they had had no stock for a week. Yet with 4 daily flights to/from BKK, surely the world's best airline could figure out a way to get a stack of them back to Doha!",Business,5

My guess that this enabled the service of a snack and a light meal on the 6 and 10 hours sectors. Personally i'd rather have dinner at 7 on the short sector. Breakfast much later on the long sector to try to get a sleep. Serving a snack later would be enough.,Economy,8

These should be readily available as in times past. Unfortunately only one main meal was served on this leg, plus what could only be described as a snack.

On the first leg of my journey, I literally had to run to the gate for my second flight and I almost reached at the nick of time. The connection time was around 1.5 hours and my baggage was missing at Cochin. However, airport staff made arrangements to record my details and it was home delivered after almost 40 hours. I found out that the baggage of almost 15 to 20 passengers was not transferred to the second flight in Abu Dhabi. I thought this was a one-off incident as it was the first time ever my baggage was lost.  On the second leg of my journey, my flight was to depart from Cochin at 4.40am on 14th June, but the flight arrived at around 5am and departed at around 6am. I was pretty sure that I was going to miss my flight as the connection time was again around 1.5 hours. I missed my flight and I was given a boarding pass for the next flight which departs at 2.10am on 15th June. This was almost 18 hours at the airport. I was given meal vouchers and a facility to sleep in a sleeping pod. The staff at the transfer desk said that they don’t have enough resources in the airport for staying and therefore gave me the sleeping pod. In fact I found that they have an airport hotel, which they could have made available for hapless passengers like me. I was not the only one and many like me were stranded. Etihad was handling this procedure of managing stranded passengers so efficiently that I think that their stranded-passenger-management system is much more efficient than their airline management and scheduling system.  This seems to be a routine procedure for Etihad. I boarded my flight and it reached Munich and I was more than unpleasantly surprised to find out that my baggage is missing again. I got my baggage a few days later. The air stewardesses were a grumpy lot, maybe they are overworked, I don’t know. The food and service was not good and this is a completely overrated airline.

No announcements were made about our delay, but the Germanwings flight at the gate next to us were told frequently how long they were being delayed by.

On this particular flight, the cabin was half full, but the crew rushed the service to an extent I have never seen before: the pre-dinner drinks were served, and less than 5 minutes later, I was served the first course. I did not even start the salad when the plate was taken away and I was presented with a beef fillet that was totally overcooked. Ten minutes later, the trays were taken away, and the lights dimmed.

Both flights were slightly delayed by 10-15mins but arrived on time. Online check in via the Norwegian app from LGW was great, the self tagging and bag drop all worked a treat. Boarding organized and surprisingly fast. 737-800 looked new and clean. The free onboard wifi was fast and greatly appreciated. Seat comfort and legroom was fine considering the length of the flight. Service at counter and onboard seemed friendly enough. Point one -It was unfortunate that there is no through-check in with Norwegian which meant, upon arrival at CPH, going through immigration, getting bags, clearing customs and checking in again and doing that whole security rigmarole for the JFK flight. The boarding on that flight was orderly though very slow as it was a full flight. Once airborne, the crew were friendly and pleasant. Both meals ordered were served and decent.  Point two - While the much touted IFE system is great the selection of movies and TV shows available was very limited and dated. Seat comfort and legroom is reasonable. Takeaway - For the price Norwegian beats out a lot of 'full service' airlines. It doesn't feel as 'cheap' as other LCCs.

A few of our fellow passengers were an issue, with what we understood to be their pre-emptively abrupt attitude with staff which was mildly unpleasant and entirely unnecessary but perhaps a hangover of Ryanair of old.

125,condor-airlines,Eric Miller,2015-07-03,"Booked to go from Portland, Oregon to Tel Aviv, Israel for a 2 week trip. Outbound Alaska Air from Portland to Vegas, Condor Vegas to Frankfurt, El Al Frankfurt to Tel Aviv. Only learned after booking the flight that I could not check-in online, but instead had to check-in with each carrier at Portland, Vegas and Frankfurt airports. This meant arriving in Vegas, exiting security, collecting bags, waiting in line to check in and re-check bags, and then re-entering security. Bags were booked through Frankfurt to our final destination, but in Frankfurt we had to go through customs/passport clearance to exit the terminal in order to be able to check in for the next flight. Return Tel Aviv - Frankfurt - Portland we had 1 hr 50 mins between flights and only just made the connection - we were the last people to board. To top it off, when the bus brought us around to board the plane on the tarmac, I noticed my bag sitting on a baggage cart. Only when I spoke to a supervisor did he go over and tell a handler to put the bag on the plane. After getting to Portland, my bag arrived but my wife's and two sons' three bags did not. We filed lost bag reports with a ""Condor rep"" who was at baggage claim. Now it's been 48 hrs and after waiting 30 minutes on hold on the phone, Condor is claiming that they aren't responsible for the lost bags and we need to talk with Portland Airport lost and found.

The aircraft from Bangkok to Delhi was absolutely filthy. Some sticky liquid had probably been spilt all over the tray table. Jet Airways has dropped in its standard of service over time.

Smart attractive and efficient cabin crew, constant use of customer names (they memorized them from manifest before we boarded), well-maintained cabins, and delicious, plentiful food. High-end spirits and wines, including two choices for champagne, one of which was Krug. Quite simply, it was eleven hours of air travel the way it should be. As one example of the personal service I received, a FA noticed me yawn briefly after dinner and drinks, and in a heartbeat she was at my seat asking if I wanted her to make it into a bed. I told her not right now, thanks, and she said fine – but then when I wasn't looking she came up and made the seat across the aisle (first class wasn't full) into a bed. and a few minutes after that she came by and said there's your bed when you need it. So I went across and used it, put a blanket over me and the seatbelt over that, and went to sleep. I vaguely remember gentle touching while dozing. Come to find out later, when I was asleep she came by, thought the blanket wasn't classy enough and tucked me in with a duvet on top of that.  If I had to pick any nits, it would be the first-class 'suite' ground lounge in Tokyo. No real problems, nice enough food (plus Lindt chocolates which can help everything!), but it didn't match up with Qantas SYD, Cathay Pacific HKG or Lufthansa FRA. And onboard, the the wifi service was usage-based, way overpriced, slow and not user friendly when one reached the quota. I am told, however, that as soon as this month ANA is moving from the usage to a time-based system. Finally, as nice as the ""square suites"" are, in a window suite the wall of the square interferes with a good view. But truly, those are nits. This was a terrific flight.",First,10

No ground staff was available, phone calls to Germanwings were not answered. No meal voucher was offered. To add insult to injury, access to Star Alliance lounges is denied to Gold members outside Germany when you travel with Germanwings because they are a Lufthansa subsidiary but not a member of Star Alliance.

On information desk they said tha my flight was rescheduled from 17.20 to 20.35. There was no sign of delay on the schedule screen and at 14.00 there were no notices about the delay on the company's site - it appeared much later. The contact center could not comment the delay and sent to the company's representative in Varna Airport. In the airport they could not provide any information either. Later on we discovered that due to the low volume of passengers our flight was combined with the flight going from Tel-Aviv to Varna via Burgas (which of course, the company was aware of much in advance). No services were forseen for the passengers in delay. A lot of passengers were with small babies and with connecting flights to other destinations from Moscow. There were at least two options for such passengers to depart earlier with other companies but Bulgaria Air refused to change tickets saying that the flights were fully booked and there were no tickets (while there were tickets available on the sites of these companies). After a 1.5 hours of battle with Bulgaria Air representative, they agreed to provide water and a sandwich. But they provided no sitting places for the passengers and no check-in till 18.35. So that the passengers had to organize on their own at least to safeguard the luggage (so that single moms and other travellers could go to bathroom or caffeteria without bags). Just some time before 20.35 they re-scheduled the flight again - till 21.00. But at 21.00 the only airplane in the airport departed for Minsk (not for Moscow) leaving small kids and their families on the ground on their feet for over 5 hrs by that time. As a matter of fact the company organized additional juice and water distribution to passengers - this was instead of hot meals and hotels which the company refused to provide. At 21.00 there was a notice on Bulgaria Air official site that the flight had departed at 20.35. The company representative appeared at 21.15 - after the passenger riot explaining that the plane would land from Tel-Avive at 21.10 and depart from Burgas at 21.30 and assured that it would depart for Moscow at 22.20 (which does not seem to be feasible).

I had not noticed at booking to change the meals to vegetarian. However the staff on board had vegetarian food available and ground staff organised it for return flight. Plenty of films. Water and fruit juice was regularly brought round, so we were not dehydrated. I wondered why the window screens were kept down and lights dimmed for majority of the journey?

The service that was unparalleled, our flight attendant was exactly what her title states - very attentive not only for myself and partner but for everybody else around her. She was very knowledgeable in regards to food menu, beverages provided and even had held her own when another passenger requested for a specific cocktail, that she knew how to whip up. This caught the requesting passenger off guard, funny moment. The complementary Ipads being offered were a nice touch, not needed but it is always nice to have options, and flying in the J cabin with Air Canada Rouge was well worth it all. My only complaint was if you were sitting in the last row in J cabin, there's a curtain to section you off from the rest of the aircraft except for a hole between you and the person beside you, ie. the arm rest area, there is a large hole for someone from behind you to peep and see through, personally, it is a minor detail but I can imagine a person who has business or work to do would appreciate the complete privacy instead of having that large gap.

The outward leg from BHX to CDG was fine, didn't expect to be served a snack but the croissant was practically inedible and thrown straight in the bin. The organisation at CDG was lacking. There was a delay of 45 minutes on the ground with no explanation from the staff, then the gate of departure was changed to a gate that was already boarding a separate flight to Dubai, with the new gate's screen not being updated to reflect this. This caused a large rush of people and a lot of anger and confusion, and although the staff did make an announcement confirming the Chicago-bound passengers were to board first, this didn't feel like enough as a lot of people remained confused and unsure of what was happening. We were then delayed for a further hour on the tarmac, although we were kept updated by the captain regarding this. Seats were okay, food was okay, a good selection of entertainment but the quality of the screens is poor and the sets only designed for the headsets handed out so sound quality was abysmal on normal headphones. There's a good selection of drinks (including complementary alcohol) and the flight staff were friendly and attentive. Not the best trans-atlantic flight I've ever had, but far from the worst.

Was made to wait 6 hours for my next flight and thankfully, the flight was smooth and inflight crew were courteous. Ground Crew at London Heathrow however were unprofessional.",Economy,6
166,lufthansa,K Nyman Metcalf,2015-07-24,"Lufthansa used to be the best European airline, not least due to their care for ensuring connections even in case of delays. I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not Lufthansa´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew. I am afraid Lufthansa is rapidly ceasing to be my first choice. What a shame, when only better information would deal with this problem. The very value for money that I used to appreciate - pay more but get something for it - rapidly slips with such treatment.",Business,3

Spirit reps couldn't get us (traveling with a 7 month old baby) on a flight until Monday afternoon, this was Saturday. Spirit did not give us any vouchers even though we were delayed, delayed and delayed for maintenance and then cancelled. We had to rent a car and book a hotel for 2 nights in Atlantic city.

168,aeroflot-russian-airlines,A Zalewski,2015-06-13,"This was my first experience with Aeroflot and I was pleasantly surprised with the airline. In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers. While I had a problem free flight, I saw a number of other passengers struggle to sort out problems with ground staff at the SVO transfer desk.",Economy,8

While the organization that paid for my flight booked an economy ticket, I noticed the opportunity to bid on premium economy tickets for 3 of the 4 legs of our round-trip flights. Our bids were accepted for two of the flights, but not accepted for the third. Ironically, this is the one leg for which we had bid the most because we hadn't been able to secure good seats in the economy class. Even more ironic, when we checked in for this specific leg, we asked if there was an opportunity to upgrade class and we were able to do so at half the cost of what we had bid. Overall, the experience in premium economy was good. Much more room than the typical economy seat. But one leg was a bad experience. On the final leg, the seat map that we used to choose our seats was not accurate. It showed our two seats being in front of a set of bathrooms. When we boarded the plane, we found that our row was actually the first row after the bathrooms. Because we were on the side row, there was no wall or curtain between us and the bathroom. It essentially became a seven-hour flight sitting next to the bathroom. We would have been much better off with our original economy seats. I'm surprised that Lufthansa would not have designed this section better and that they didn't have a more accurate seat map.",Premium Economy,5

I was thinking this would be the worst part of our trip - but it wasn't. On the way home - our flight was delayed yet again. We flew out 2 hours after our original flight was scheduled, which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. There were no later flights, so we had to stay overnight. When I asked them about a room, along with many other passengers, we were given a discounted rate at a hotel 15 miles from the airport.

So I had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap items to get my boarding pass. On the plane I had to sit next to a very fat man (not BAs fault) and the food was disgusting. Some rubber chicken with four strips of gravy-sodden potato wedges. No vegetables. Second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge. No salad, yoghurt or other goodies. Between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. IFE had the smallest screen I have ever seen, and a poor choice of films.

To save time at our connection in FCO (only 45 minutes!), the Alitalia check-in employee gave us boarding passes for OTP-FCO and FCO-JFK, however the check-in line was very slow. First flight was normal with nothing special. Flight was delayed by 15 minutes due to air-traffic in Rome. Fairly clean aircraft. They served us some crackers, but nothing more. However, never fly Alitalia long-haul economy unless it's your only option! Ground services were pretty slow. We had to wait 15 minutes for a bus to drive us to terminal 3! Flight to New York also delayed, this time by an hour. Seats in the plane were extremely uncomfortable, there was an entertainment equipment box blocking me from having legroom, outdated entertainment systems, and bad food.

Air Canada Rouge was very comfortable for the longer flights overseas - even offering meals, snacks, blankets and pillows. The inflight entertainment we used on our own Apple devices worked very well, and there was one plug in our seat area for charging. It was nice to be able to choose our seats ahead of time with no charges as well. The most positive thing we have to say about our flights is that I accidentally left my ipad mini on board our very last flight going into Halifax. The flight attendant went out of her way to turn my ipad into lost and found and even emailed me telling me this. It had ended up in St John's, NFLD, where we arranged pick up to have it returned to us. We received it a couple of days later. I am very thankful and grateful to her and the other employees in lost and found who made sure I received my ipad back! As far as I'm concerned, they went above and beyond.",Economy,8

211,hawaiian-airlines,B Ross,2015-07-19,"AKL-HNL on a modern A330 in Extra Comfort seat in 11A. An excellent option at a small cost for the 9 hr long overnight flight. Whilst the seat was the same as Economy Class and the armrest was fixed, this row is situated directly behind Business Class in a small intimate cabin at the front of the plane. The leg room was huge, improving comfort and thus the ability to get some sleep. Return HNL-AKL afternoon flight was in standard Economy seat 18A and whilst a little tight when the person in front reclined, it was perfectly adequate and comfortable. On-demand movies / TV series / games were free and it was fun to watch some Hawaii-centric shows. The touch screen was not very responsive and there was no alternative controls resulting in a lot of unnecessary ""poking"". Upon embarkation, FA's handed out amenity kits comprising eye masks, headphones, earplugs and in Extra Comfort seats additional items were included in a cute little pouch. Food and drink service was prompt after takeoff and I think relevant to the time of travel. A snack pack was offered at midnight with a breakfast before arrival then on the return a hot chicken/rice dish at late PM takeoff with a sandwich as a late supper. Much better than a curry at 3am as I have experienced on some airlines. Service friendliness and professionalism was mixed depending on which crew member attended you (as always) and the return was much better but overall more than adequate. Water was offered frequently throughout the flight. My only negative would be the temperature of the cabin - it was freezing cold! The FA's were even wearing cardigans. And the complimentary blanket smelled like it had been in a smokers zone - it was disgusting. Fortunately I had packed my own. Overall I was very impressed with the flights. It represented good value and the inclusion 2 checked bags in the fare was a bonus. I would recommend this airline for this route and will fly with them again.

Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business.

This is my second time to fly PAL and I always fly business class with other airlines. I cannot recommend this airline for business class. Perhaps economy would be more suitable.

After the no-frills flight from TXL to CDG and a stop-over stay in Paris, we boarded the B777 through the SkyPriority gate (which we also were able to use at check-in and security) and found the seats to be quite good: fixed shell (very rare in Premium Economy) and ample legroom, Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones, a decent IFE screensufficient storage space. As others mentioned before, there is no real decline and the seat cushions were worn out which led us to use the cushions handed out to make sitting a little bit more comfortable. Good quality amenity kits were handed out. Food and drinks: after champagne for aperitif, designated Premium Economy menu cards were handed out. We were served the main cabin economy lunch, but on a different tray. The food was among the best we have had in economy both quality and quantity wise. It was accompanied by wine which was presented restaurant style in a real glass. Digestifs were followed by a cornet filled with sweets. Before landing, a yummy pizza pocket was served. Fight attendants were always approachable, friendly and courteous. We would book AF's premium economy again whenever possible, especially because of the fixed shell seat and great food.",nan,9
220,volaris,Linda Bennet,2015-07-14,"Their website is a joke, call center is worse. I spent hours online trying to pay for an extra piece of luggage the day before I traveled. The website would not allow me to prepay it just kept taking me back to the home page. I tried calling the call center and got the same thing, a recorded message advertising all the additional services but no live person to talk to. I ended up having to pay at check-in and was made to pay $100.00 for one extra bag. When I voiced the issues with their website I was told I should have called the call center. Also, the live chat feature on their website does not work (big surprise). To add insult to injury, they said my carry on was too big and wanted me to pay another $100.00 to check that bag!! Same carry on I use at other airlines with no issues. I said forget it and asked them bring the bag I had just paid $100.00 to check, so that I could put my carry on items in that bag. I was told ""that's not going to happen"" even though I could still see my bag on the belt. At this point I threw a fit right there at the LAX counter. Thirty minutes later I was given back my bag. I am normally a very calm person but what made the whole experience so irritating was the rude and condescending attitude from the Volaris reps. Absolutely no attempt to try to make one feel better about being ripped off. Same thing happened with the website and call center when I tried to pay for the extra luggage on the return trip. This time I actually called another number as if I wanted to buy a new ticket and that's how I finally got a live representative on the phone. He was nice and was able to add the extra bag in advance. It still cost $65.00 for the extra bag but I guess it's better than $100.00. Total round trip cost LAX to Aguas Calientes = $545.00.

Being able to fly directly into regional airports missing out Heathrow is a big plus. Seat comfort not great, then no economy seat is comfortable for 11 hours! I did find the seats very hard and I needed to sit on a pillow. The flight was extremely full - every seat taken, good for the airline but not good for passengers! Food a mixed bag, good dinner on way back but no breakfast served before arrival in Perth instead a chicken dinner meal? Would have preferred a cold breakfast - fruit or just a bread roll option. A potato sandwich was served as a snack before landing in Manchester. The pasta dish was good and the noodle dish was excellent. Ground staff did take a bottle of suntan lotion bought in duty free at Manchester fully sealed in a tamper proof bag with receipt showing, despite being assured by the shop assistant in Manchester that it would not be a problem transiting with it so long as it was in the tamper proof bag. Etihad please communicate with other airports re this if this is your policy! Another point on transiting, I fully understand the need for enhanced security at the gate however once you are in the gate you cannot go out and there is no water available or toilet facilities in the gate.

At time of booking I advised of a wheelchair requirement. It was not offered at either airport and non were available. I attempted to check in online without success, so when I got to the airport I was charged $10.00 for a boarding pass. When I advised of my inability to check in online, I was told that was my problem. The return trip was delayed for 1 hour while we sat on the plane. The cabin personnel were very hospitable and helped offset some of the other negatives but not enough to get me to fly Allegiant again.",Economy,4

For years I preferred British Airways and would travel to London as there is no direct flights from where I live. Then I gave that up and stuck with Virgin due to time. For the last two years I have travelled to different destinations. This year I wanted to go back to Barbados and opted for a Virgin flight. I must say this was the best decision!! The flight was good the food was good and the service was excellent- no request was to big or small and all with a smile.

SQ861 on 27/6, delayed by around half an hour, but flight crew handled the flight efficiently. Window seat on the A380-800 was slightly wider, more comfortable than other ordinary seats. Cabin crew provided highly professional service throughout the journey and had frequent cabin presence. An incredible range of inflight movies including Asian and international films, with fairly large screens. Inflight meal was above average, though not impressive. Cabin temperature was too cold and more than half of the passengers had put their blankets on.

Food at Sydney was excellent, (first time that we've eaten in the lounge), but elsewhere was only adequate. (Why offer a fish main course on the flights which is not available by the time that you're asked?). Entertainment system broke down on two legs - but was fixed relatively quickly.

258,etihad-airways,Laurence McCarthy,2015-06-23,"Have flown Etihad for many years. My last trip has made me somewhat less enthusiastic. Issues started when I went to KL Ticket Office to change my flights. They changed flights for GBP300 per seat, used to be GBP175 and told me I could no longer have a car from Heathrow to my home at the end of the journey. I explained that I was offered a car when I made the booking, but they said the fare rules had now changed and I was no longer entitled a car. After much complaining and nearly an hour waiting I finally got to speak with the local General Manager. I again stressed I had been offered a car when the booking was made, so I felt they could not simply change the rules. Eventually after 4 days of back and to emails, they confirmed the car from Heathrow. Check in is always a disaster, ditto the Lounge they use. With a couple of flights a day and now with First Class they should either choose a new partner or open their own lounge. The Emirates Lounge is fantastic at KLIA. Flights okay, service and quality of food definitely on the down swing. It's okay but used to be great. Bigger planes mean less attention for passengers which is were Etihad scored in the past.

That was a big mistake. Spirit Airlines charges 100 US Dollars for a carry-on bag! The flight was fine, but since I was in an Airbus A320, the seats did not recline.

They lead to believe you have to purchase your seats when another traveler with lost baggage said he believes if you don't pick a seat and they issue it at airport check-in it may be free. I didn't see that as an option but that I had to pick and pay for the seat.

270,sunwing-airlines,M Woods,2015-06-13,"Our non-stop return flight from Jamaica to Toronto was changed mid vacation to include a ""stopover"" in Punta Cana. On boarding we were told we would be dropping off passengers to Punta Cana before heading to Toronto, adding an additional 1.5 hrs to our flight, including an additional takeoff and landing. In fact we were late leaving due the luggage needing to be re-balanced. On arrival in Punta Cana, approx. 20 passengers got off. Apparently they had been diverted from Toronto to Jamaica to spend the night before continuing to their destination of Punta Cana the following morning, due to their flight not being full enough? When the passengers had left the plane we were further delayed by more rebalancing of luggage and refuelling. Re-fuelling, and rebalancing completed, imagine our shock with yet a further delay as Sunwing made some additional cash by loading some fresh fruits and vegetable cargo onto to our plane! Then some additional unloading as they backed some of the cargo off of the plane as they apparently loaded too much. All said and done we sat on the runway for two hours, with a plane full of passengers and young children. We were not permitted to leave the plane, it was very warm and crowded. We were able to use the washrooms, but the line-ups were long and the facilities very messy due to the overuse. No food or beverages were provided during this time and many of the children were cranky, hot and tired resulting in passenger/parent altercations breaking out all over the plane. It was very quickly becoming a very hostile environment. Additionally the inflight entertainment system had stopped functioning mid flight so all passengers could do during the two hour torture session was stare at the clock ticking off a lengthy delay and stare out the window at a very inept airport crew dropping luggage onto the Tarmac. The flight crew lacked a single drop of empathy at passengers comments, in fact when I asked what they were going to do for us to compensate us for our time and discomfort the response I received was that ""they would get us to our destination safely"". So in the end when we finally took off and reached our destination of Toronto, our 4 hr direct flight turned into over 8 hrs, with a 3 hr pre-flight arrival at the airport making our journey over 11 hrs. We were provided with a snack and a glass of wine, and a sandwich.  Disgusting, negligent, irresponsible, unacceptable.

Finally, it took 46 hours in total to reach Amsterdam (includes delay, overnight stay, flights in transit) from Auckland. Better communication to stranded passengers would have resulted in an ideal outcome as we were unsure as to how long we would be stranded in Bangkok and the location of our luggage.

No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",Economy,3

Contrary to previous flight (SYD-SCL) in Premium Economy, the cabin crew (CC) offered no help to store hand luggage in overhead locker despite seeing my difficulty in doing so. Despite ample space in front of my seat to move around, staff disturbed passengers next to me by passing and collecting from them my food trays, until I politely asked them to step around to my seat to do so - which they did but offering no apology for their carelessness. Food was the worst consisting of fish or meat, a hard bun and a dry dessert - no salad, butter or cheese. Snack was an ice cream almost thrown at you whether you liked it or not in the middle of sleeping time. Drinks however were readily available. Very cheap and poor entertainment and poor quality headphones.",Economy,3

Delta later modified my outbound flight and added a SEA stop between SJC and ATL, which added several hours to an already long trip, and this is the low point of my experience. SEA-ATL flight was delayed by 3 hours, and gate agents got us pizza and soft drinks, and alcohol was free during that delayed flight (delays happen, and these gate agents and FA's looked after us very well). Home-bound, ATL-SJC flight arrived 25 mins late. The other 3 flights were on time and uneventful. The check-in, gate, and onboard staff were friendly and efficient. I was surprised to be offered 3 choices for dinner on transatlantic flights, as well as a small mid-flight snack on BCN–ATL flight in economy class. Flight attendants were present through the flight. Seat-back screens provided great options for individual entertainment. The extra leg-room, boarding priority, and premium drink, are well worth the cost of a Comfort+ seat. I wish seats were wider but this is true of every airline I've flown in economy class. Luggage arrived on time. I will recommend this airline for international flights.

The food is as bad as it was, but I'd say that for the price this is to be expected. I never have any expectations regarding the food they will serve so I'm not disapointed. They are usually still the cheapest for CDG to YUL so if I wanted something a tad better I'd pay a bit more.

Both flights were more or less on time, and the outward boarding was quite smooth. The bad. On the outward flight awful overpriced food was offered and there were 2 ‘scratch card runs ‘. On a two and a half hour flight? There being no on board magazine or duty free menu is it any wonder nobody buys any duty free goods – nobody has any idea what is for sale. At the end of the flight there was no thanks or goodbye as we left the plane the first time in 35 years I have ever had this. The two cabin crew by the rear doors totally ignored the departing passengers whilst chatting in their own language. Very unprofessional cabin crew that day. On the journey back the cabin crew were much better. There was only one scratchcard run and one hard sell on the breakfast lasagne that ‘melted in your mouth ‘. No thanks. Our real issue as we were waiting in the queue (towards the back) to embark a ground staff came up the line and attached yellow stickers to our hand luggage and boarding pass. She spoke no English, and we eventually worked out our hand luggage (which was all we had by choice) was now going in the hold. This was a bit of a disaster for us as we were now being forced to wait at the baggage reclaim at the other end , a wait which proved to be about half an hour meaning we overshot out car parking time and had to pay excess. Despite this sticker business some people behind us in the queue were removing the stickers prior to embarking and just taking the luggage on the plane anyway. But we played the game and tried to safeguard some delicate stuff we had. Despite this on arrival home we found that some articles were damaged, something that should never have happened in the first place. So, in a nutshell if you are prepared to forsake everything for a cheap flight Ryanair are the best in the business. If the travelling is a big part of your trip, avoid them like the plague.

As I had pre-booked an exit row seat I had to counter check-in rather than use the self-serve kiosks but there was no waiting and quickly processed by friendly staff. At the gate, carry-on bags were being checked ad-hoc. Boarding was efficient and quick which allowed for an early departure. The aircraft was spotless and it was great to have cloth seats rather than the faux leather of Virgin. Yes its buy on board, but a good range of drinks and snacks were available. Very friendly cabin crew and great communication from the flight deck. It was actually the first time that I was asked if I needed assistance to place my bag in the overhead locker. Seat comfort no different to economy on Qantas, Virgin or Jetstar and in fact it seemed that the seats were wider than on the Qantas and Virgin 737's. Since being taken over by Virgin, Tiger certainly seemed to have improved and as long as you follow the rules concerning check in times and carry-on limits they provide quality safe air travel at quite reasonable prices when compared with Virgin and Qantas. You have to ask for the majority of flights in Australia under 3 hours, is the extra money to fly Qantas or Virgin for a complimentary muffin worth it.

This being our second flight in 7 days we were expecting a little more enthusiasm and pride in their work from crew members.

Price not very far from the competing airline that offers direct route from DMM-MNL  (about 50 to 100 SAR difference) but still provides full airline service. One negative thing is the boarding gate in MNL airport terminal 1. There were not enough seats for the all the passengers. Some were standing up while waiting for boarding. Check-in process was OK.

Staff were extremely slow for simple bag check-ins as well as unfriendly and unprofessional. Flight was delayed 4 hours because the crew needed time off. Does US Airways only have one crew available? The flight finally got off the ground 4 hours and 45 minutes later than scheduled. Because I was just taking a day trip to Philadelphia to drop off someone who had a 10 hour layover it ended up being a waste of money for me. For my return flight from Philadelphia they announced that there would be a 10 minute delay because - you guessed it - they were short on personnel. The 10 minutes turned into over an hour before they could get a first officer and 2 flight attendants. The service on board on both flights was poor. The attendants were cold and impersonal. The gate personnel at Orlando were the absolute unfriendliest I have seen in over 45 years of flying. US Airways used to be a good airline that I enjoyed flying with, but since the fusion they are just a shadow of what they used to be and even worse than their partner American Airlines.

After take-off when the flight attendant came around with water, I asked if there was a problem with the air-conditioning and was told that it was due to the plane sitting on the ground all day in the sun. The flight attendant moved me to a seat further forward which was cooler. On SYD-WLG leg, I’d pre-ordered my meal, as the option was offered when I went to online check-in.

However, on every sector except from London to Dubai, the seats were changed in every instance to those in the middle - four of us! I telephoned the booking offices at each location, who refused to help, then at the check in counter at each airport who were very unhelpful. It was a long journey which we had to endure. I found almost all of their staff, be it Cabin Crew or Counter Staff to be very robotic in their attitude. No customer service at all. No friendly disposition, no making eye contact and overall they all looked very tired. The food provided on the aircraft was more than ample. However, this is not enough to sway me to fly with them again.

We asked the mother once of the problem yet the child continued. Asked again to please have your child stop the kicking. Third time was enough and flight crew intervened and helped settle the problem. A cookie for the kicking child and a glass of wine for us. Very odd situation but handled OK by crew. Overall the flight seemed short handed, stressed and just did not want to do their job. Return flight back was like night and day. Our baggage was well above the limit but nothing was said and they checked us in with no questions. Both flights were on time. Ground staff friendly and helpful, cabin crew were friendly, helpful and outgoing. Meals were actually tasty and there were non-stop beverage runs.

The last time I flew the check-in staff said there was absolutely no way I could bring it on board. We argued back and forth, got managers involved, threatened to change our flights. Eventually we got approval. A previous time I flew Cathay I booked my ticket at the last minute due to a medical emergency with my wife. I had a 50 minute layover in Tokyo, but that was the best I could do. I went to the airport the night before to try and be put on standby on a flight that evening so I would certainly make my connection. I have never been treated so poorly. Nobody would listen to what was going on. Everyone just said no and walked away. Turns out the flight was not even full, they were just not willing to help. The flights are wonderful however. The planes are well-maintained and seats are comfortable. Staff are quite attentive and friendly. The food was decent for airplane food. In-flight entertainment was as good as any I have experienced.

Of note the complimentary white wine was better than the wine that we had in business on the way down and it was cold. Coming down none of the cold drinks in business had been cooled down, so we had wine with ice cubes.

We sat in exit rows on all the flights, and in seats that allowed conversation with them. We specifically chose a window seat for one of our legs of the trip, but the flight attendant made a mistake and thought we were in the wrong seat because another passenger thought he had the window seat exit row. The attendant told us we were wrong, so we made the move per request, then quietly pointed out we had been in the correct seats all along. The attendant apologized, but didn't ask the other passenger to move to his ticketed seat. My husband had circulation problems, so we specifically wanted the seat we had requested as it allowed more leg room.

Star Alliance Gold passengers can access the lounge for free-a nice feature. The flight departs on time. I thought the aircraft A319 would be an antique. I was wrong. The A319 is in excellent shape, clean and well-kept, including IFE with dozens of programs at every seat even on short domestic flights. Nice leather seats. Seat pitch is reasonable. Flight attendants look sharp and professional. On this short domestic flight, refreshment is coffee or juices. I paid about $80 for a one-way one hour flight with a 7-day advance purchase.

We just had to figure it out on our own. Was able to get my kids together at least because they had split up another 2 people and by just swapping seats in the same row it put family members together.

When I arrived at the airport in Sydney yet more flights (to Melbourne) were cancelled and my own flight disappeared from the departure board! There was no explanation for this or for the cancelations during the day. Or rather, talking to many frustrated passengers, it seems that Virgin had given no fewer than 5 different explanations ranging from 'bad weather' (not true as we checked most of the Australian cities), mechanical problems, change of equipment (but again no explanation provided), 'just don't know' (statement made by reservation staff to several passengers) and so on. We understand that problems occur at all airlines from time to time but the real test of a good airlines is its commitment to keep customers informed and on a regular basis, whenever problems arise. On this occasion, Virgin's performance was abysmally poor. My flight eventually left Sydney 45 minutes late. I was lucky as all around me at the Sydney airport dozens of irate passengers were being told that they wouldn't be able to fly until the next day. Again, no explanation.",Economy,2
389,eastern-airways,Christopher Pell,2015-07-25,I have used Eastern Airways for a number of years as my commute to work in the offshore industry. They have always been expensive and have the monopoly on this route. I note when another carrier recently went into completion with them for the Aberdeen route from Leeds Bradford their prices dropped dramatically. I used to book the zonal route pass which bought 6 return flights with full flexibility for around £1700. For my last 6 return flights I booked the 13.10 to DTV. Eastern Airways after accepting my booking and payment cancelled 4 of them on the return portion for operational reasons which were half term holidays and such like. I had to take a later flight which got me to my destination later than had I used the train at a significantly lower cost. The last two flights from DTV to Aberdeen were late and cancelled also. Technical problems sometimes occur and have to be accepted but it seems much more common lately. This airline is unreliable and accepts bookings offering flexibility and then removes the flexibility. I note another offshore workers review states that nobody within the industry has a good word for them and I agree with his statement. A budget airline experience at premium prices.

395,southwest-airlines,Terry Booth,2015-07-21,"On a recent flight originating from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Richmond, connecting in Atlanta, the plane arrived to the terminal on time and was expected to depart on time. After the incoming passengers exited, the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. After a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. In a confusing and poor miscommunication between the Gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. I checked the Arrivals/Departures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing Southwest flights were being delayed by hours. Another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled Flight 1505 would not be departing at all. A different plane would be assigned to Fort Lauderdale once it landed from Atlanta. This would be around 10.20 pm. We were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever Southwest could come up with. My best option was to wait until Monday to get back to Richmond. I tactfully informed the Gate Agent that that was not an option as I had a job to return to. I asked about a flight closer to Richmond, ready to be boarded. I was told that option wasn't available, and there was nothing left. Finally I asked if another flight could get us closer to Richmond, and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. Again, nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. Then a option to book a flight to BWI was available, arriving at 2.00 am. No hotels were available. I again asked about car rental. I was informed Southwest didn't offer or would pay for a rental. No other airline was available either, seems SW doesn't work with anyone else either. We took the flight to BWI, and had to get a rental at 2.00 am.  Arriving home at 5.00 am, and with a extreme distaste for the way Southwest treats their paying customers, we decided never to use this carrier again. ",Economy,1

On this flight, I thought again that its time passengers were allowed to tip cabin crew for good service. One again wonders why this is not allowed?

We even boarded the plane and were later asked to de-board due to mechanical issues after waiting in the plane for 2 hours. Due to the delay we did not have a ride home. Therefore we had to pay for a very expensive cab ride. Of course they refused to compensate us claiming that any delays are not the responsibility of the airline. The only compensation was a meal voucher which we had to use within 45 min or we were out of luck. And good luck speaking to a live person at customer service. There is no such thing.

Only 2 counters open and after about 40 minutes they realised they weren't going to get everyone done before the flight left so opened another one. No time to do anything then before we went to the gate. Boarding was announced and then one of the two staff disappeared so we waited for 10 minutes for him to come back. They let us on first as we were travelling with a toddler which is the only positive of this flight. They needn't have bothered though as departure time came and went. No announcements before finally got one 15 minutes after due to leave to say we would be leaving in 10 minutes. 20 minutes before landing we finally got offered a drink. At baggage claim our bags were not on the belt. We were making an onward connection to Kittila the next day and for some reason our bags had been checked through.

Since my husband and I don't use electronic devices, we went old school and read whatever magazines we happened to bring with us.

Overall, the menu and beverage options are very limited and the service is very poor. Our children, my husband and I went over 12 hours without a meal - all the meals offered at Air China have a spicy taste. We were expecting a fair menu for all cultures and especially a fair menu for our children. Our toddler couldn't even get a second order of apple juice because it was all gone! During our first flight with Air China from Australia to Beijing, I asked to have a replacement of food from steak to chicken, thinking it was less spicy, and I received a chicken meal prepared with extra cardamom. I asked the flight attendant about it and he said that all customers that returned their first meal get the 2nd meal with an extra spice taste!

The first leg was delayed by an unknown amount because of maintenance issues. They bumped me and other passengers to a different plane so that we would make our connections (after delaying for about 1 hour and 45 minutes), which was appreciated but I ended up in a terrible seat and still cutting it extremely close and I have no idea when the original plane actually ended up taking off. We landed in Toronto and almost ran off the plane to try to make what I thought would be a very short connection of about 30 minutes in a huge airport. Turns out the next leg was also delayed, so far by 2 hours (I'm still sitting her, waiting to board and fuming) for, again, maintenance. Apparently this time they know what's wrong but they have to go get a part to replace something in one of the pilot/copilots chairs? At least that's what I gleaned from the flight attendants and various other passengers discussing the issue. I understand that delays happen sometimes. But its a little ridiculous for both of these planes to need last minute maintenance. We haven't been offered any kind of compensation for all of this trouble and I'm annoyed.

The lady helping me, who was trying very hard to try and lower the price, ended up knocking it down to about $300 US. Part of this issue was that they charged me for oversize and overweight for my ski bag. Most airlines charge a base $100 and the weight doesn't matter unless it's over the 70lbs max weight. Another lady working had rudely told me that I was not allowed to have three pairs of skis in my bag, even though there was nothing I could do about it. She ""let it slide"" and charged me instead.

I could not get any of the outlets under the seats to work, and I have never been on an international flight that did not at least have TV screens built into the seats and a USB port for passengers to charge their devices. The closest TV screen to me was in row 15 in the middle. The majority of of the films shown ended up having squiggly lines running through the screen so I could not watch and/or even make out the subtitles from where I was sitting. On this flight of roughly 10 hours, I was also shocked that the staff walked aroung only twice offering water outside of the food service. During dinner I enquired about getting a soda and they said there would be a charge! 15 minutes after that I asked a flight attendant if I could purchase a soda, and she informed me that the drink service was over and I would have to go to the back of the plane to purchase.

However, it has gotten progressively worse through the years to the point that I would rather pay a more for a ticket than fly United ever again. Our family of 5 (one of whom was a special needs daughter) was to fly from Buffalo to Chicago to San Francisco to Anchorage where we were to then start our Alaskan cruise. Upon arriving at Buffalo, the check in machine didn't work right. The lady behind the counter was nice enough but said she could not help us with gate-to-gate connection (e.g. passenger carts) as that was something ""you didn't do"" and simply didn't seem to care that we had a need. In Chicago we sat on the tarmack for almost an hour before we took off, causing us to get in late in SF for our connecting flight to Anchorage. We ran to our gate as best we could with our special needs daughter, saw our plane sitting at the gate, but weren't allowed to get on due to the gangway being pulled away from the plane already even though the United personnel told us, ""Oh, we knew you were coming. We just couldn't wait for you.""  To make matters worse United booked us on a flight to Anchorage for the next night. In the end we got flights on Alaska Airlines and got into Anchorage about 2:30am which allowed us time to sleep in our booked hotel room before making the trip to Seward by bus, getting us there in plenty of time to board our ship. Alaska Airlines personnel were superb in demeanor, helpfulness, and care, something that United personnel were seriously lacking. Our return trip from Vancouver, BC to Buffalo started out much differently than when we went. The staff in Vancouver were helpful and courteous. But once we got to Chicago, they were anything but! I think the personnel of United Airlines in the US could take a few lessons from those from our Vancouver neighbors.

Final flight was operated by SAA. This was my only option when booking for this date, so I had no choice but to accept the codeshare. Unfortunately the codesharing is limited so on check in you cannot select your seat, as a result I ended up in the last row of the plane (which I avoid like the plague) and thus was doomed with limited recline.

However, Finnair should try to invest some money into some features, otherwise it will just be another company out there. Seats are very uncomfortable and I usually use a pillow as a back support. Food is terrible, I should have taken some with me. From Helsinki to Stockholm they offered us drinks only (no snacks)! Entertainment is average. Selection of movies to choose from was not great. System froze when I tried to play some games, they had to restart the system to get it working. I don't like Helsinki airport either. They maximized space for restaurants, while passengers are left with a limited number of seats. That leaves a mass of people standing in the way. Both times I ended up almost running through airport trying to get there in time. I don't know what was going on, but I entered three toilets and all were full. Also, if I went through security check in Tokyo, do I need to go through same thing in Helsinki too? All an all, I will skip Finnair if I don't have direct flight.

Eventually our flight was cancelled. I tried to reschedule on Icelandair but Norwegian would not pay the difference. We were rebooked on a Portuguese airline for the next day. The time of that flight was changed 4 times. Lines at JFK were horrible - 200 people and not nearly the staff to handle the crowd. We were issued a $15 meal voucher and told to submit our other expenses online. Most places at the airport would not take the voucher because. We lost our seat assignments. There was no liquor on the flight - they forgot to restock - no wifi, and no in-flight entertainment. So, we get to Oslo a day late. Our return flight was scheduled for June 11th. We got to the airport 3 hours early and were advised at 6.30, our departure time, that our flight was delayed. Eventually it was cancelled and we were placed on the same Portuguese aircraft that departed Oslo around 4 am. We spent over 12 hours in the airport and were never advised that we were entitled to a hotel room. Again, we were given meal vouchers, but it was so late that every restaurant had closed. Norwegian failed to update their website and our limo went to JFK to pick us up, not knowing that we were still in Oslo. ",Economy,1

Every bag with wheels even if it does fit the requirement cost you an extra 55 dollars. On the flight you may be able to get a cup of ice for free.

Qantas lounge in Melbourne is a dark dungeon and not particularly worth the visit. Boarding was pain free although cabin crew were not well versed when it came to assisting parents with two young children. In most cases on all flights I found all cabin crew friendly but unable to take the initiative to offer services. in most cases if you wanted something you had to ask instead of being offered. These were not lazy crew, they worked hard but they were just not polished crew used to premium service. First of the two business class cabins is the better of the cabins as it feels more spacious and open. Seats are lay flat and comfortable. Inflight entertainment is lacking with random titles from the 80's and not much more if you select the Hollywood option. Hamad Intl is great and the lounge is huge and fantastic. No one explains the options available to you and your left wondering what's on offer. Great flights and great lounges in Doha and London. Food is exceptional bit staff need more training though not because they disgruntled. One incident did concern me though. The A380 has a inflight bar which on one flight was serving up excessive amounts of alcohol to two passengers who subsequently were almost restrained in their seats by crew. Cabin crew really should have stopped serving the two passengers hours before. The only major issue on an otherwise great trip. ",Business,6

Seat is quite spacious and crew is rather decent as well and that goes to the food too. Only complaint is the IFE system which couldn't be turned on for the first hour of the flight but the crew did a good job at managing it by regularly updating on what they will be doing to resolve this. Next leg is on EY73 from AUH to ZRH on an Etihad A330 (EY73). All the reviews about seat being cramped in Economy are definitely true but I would say it's not totally unbearable given that I've sat on seats with similar width and legroom before. But I must say the amount of things they give to you (blanket + amenities kit + inflight magazine + duty free mag) does make the space more cramped than usual as you need somewhere to keep all the items in. Contrary to most reviews though, the crew is quite okay though maybe not as friendly as what you have on SQ or MH. ",Economy,7

471,air-transat,N Bradford,2015-07-22,"Inconsistent. Good flight from LGW, average from YUL Montreal. Outbound: We paid extra for Option Plus, which on this occasion was well worth it. We avoided check-in queues, used the fast track security lane, boarded first and our baggage was given priority on arrival. It also gave us a total luggage allowance of 33kg over two bags. On board we were given a comfort kit, sparkling wine, snack and an alcoholic drink. Food was bearable - no different really to any other airline. Leg room was adequate and seats had a good recline, but they are not very wide, so it was very uncomfortable and I'm not a big person. I was concerned when I discovered the A310 doesn't have individual screens. Instead you have to watch on your iphone or tablet and there is no method of charging your device. Film choices appeared OK and battery held up surprisingly well. All in all we were pleasantly surprised, although our expectation couldn't be any lower because we had read all the negative reviews. Inbound: Long wait at check in, just one person checking in Option Plus passengers. Despite having priority security with our ticket we were ushered through main security lanes. Flight was slightly delayed. No apology or explanation in fact it wasn't even mention. Seat made it very uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. Food service was bizarre.

An email was sent to us at 4:30pm that day - 90 minutes after the original departure time - informing us of a substantial delay. Instead of leaving PDL at 8:15pm, as stated in the timely message, we ended up staying in the airport until 11pm - 8 hours after the original departure time. This forced us to stay an extra night in Boston and lose our connecting flight to NYC. We got to our hotel in Boston with a crying 5-month old baby at 2:30am on June 17th.

The flight to YVR was at that time a 747-400, which was aged but carefully maintained. Cabin was cold for me but extra blankets were available. Provided toothbrush kit and slippers even for economy class. Cabin crew was not good enough at English but well enough to provide services. Two meals were served and both were good. The flight itself was on time and the captain was of great professionalism, communication with cabin was made after takeoff and before landing in Korean and English, which was a nice touch especially on Asian carriers. In-flight entertainment system was available on both segments. Did not use much because the touch screen was aged and its reaction was slow.

Boarding was a mess, there is no priority boarding for business class passengers, foods are served in plastic and there's only one beverage service. Food was eatable but not top-notch. Seemed like a snack service instead of a meal as it's too light. Seat was standard Eurobiz, but enhanced like a domestic US 1st class. But the ticket is EUR 250, only 15€ more than economy, and in this case it was cheaper than full-fare economy. Wouldn't hesitate to choose them again for MAD-BCN on A330.

Economy class has tired, hard, uncomfortable seats, limited leg room. No personal TV, just overhead TV showing (bizarrely, childrens films). Cabin staff were surly, not a smile between them. All older staff, and so rude at times. The way the breakfast boxes were thrown out was embarrassing, customer service was non-existent. No offers of second drinks, all they seemed to want to do was to get the meal service over so that they could sit down and rest.

I returned to Canada from Lima on Air Canada in April. For my June flights regular Air Canada economy service is no longer available, only Rouge. Rouge is simply awful, unacceptable. The seats in Air Canada Rouge economy are the worst I have experienced in more than 40 years of international flying. They are narrow, with limited leg room and thin padding. The flight to Lima was bearable as I didn't try to sleep. The flight back was intolerable. Falling asleep in the seat resulted in back problems. I will not take Air Canada Rouge in the future if I can possible avoid it. There is no regular inflight entertainment system, the food was awful, although not necessarily worse than normal economy, and drinks cost extra. For entertainment you can supply your own mobile device and use the inflight service, if you don't have a device you can rent an ipad for $10.

488,thomas-cook-airlines,M Thomson,2015-06-16,"The only problem I have with booking through Thomas Cook is being tied into their airline for flights. Recently flew between Glasgow and Corfu, as a seasoned traveller on both scheduled and charter around the world they are easily the worst airline I've ever flown with. That included single prop local flights in the back of beyond. They are clearly letting their aged 757-200's slowly but surely crumble with the newer A321's being brought in as replacements. Having flown on several 757's I knew to expect cramped seating and miniature tray tables. However allowing the interior trim of your aircraft to fall into disrepair is unacceptable. On the outbound flight, on one of the older 757's in the fleet the toilets were looking decrepit and I noticed the tray table of the person next to me was sagging on one side. The cabin crew are friendly enough, however on the outward bound service they were extremely slow bringing the trolley down for drinks, it took a good 2.5 hours for the breakfast service to begin (around 11.30 UK time) so by then we were pretty hungry having been awake since 5. The duty free service didn't make it past row 7, and there was never a second drinks service. The inbound journey however was even worse, there was a piece of foam hanging down between the front galley and the bulkhead. The armrest on my seat was broken, with the trim hanging off the top and the seat recline button jammed in. Which I ended up fixing myself with the trim just being placed back on top. During takeoff water dripped down onto the seat next time mine, I pointed this out to the cabin crew who seemed relatively uninterested when they finally came around after a 10 minute wait from pressing the buzzer. The food on the return leg turned out to be two spicy options, chicken curry and braised beef. For some bizarre reason there were chillies through the beef.

I find it hard to believe that out of all the flights into Denver that night that Spirit was the only delay as it showed on the airport Departure/arrival board. This is how they treat customers by lying to them. ",Economy,1

503,qantas-airways,Denise Stephens,2015-06-28,"WLG-SYD went smoothly enough. Boarding in Sydney was shambolic. Staff announced that boarding would be by row number but didn’t enforce that, so people mucking around with luggage in the forward rows really held up boarding. Departure was somewhat delayed as a result. They also didn’t have arrival cards for Japan available during the flight but handed them to us as we disembarked at Narita, which wasn’t particularly helpful. When I went to online check-in, it offered the option to pre-order the meal for the SYD-NRT leg, so I opted for the No meal – I don’t want to be disturbed option, as this was an overnight flight leaving at 21.30. A flight attendant duly came up to me to ask me what my “special meal request” was. Something is not working with the pre-order option, as I had a similar thing happen on the return journey. As I got a really good promotional fare, the inconveniences outlined above were bearable, but they're not what I expect of a full-service airline.",Economy,7

It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum. Business class bag drop at 08:30 at Heathrow had mostly empty desks and a queue resulting in a quite unacceptable wait of more than 15 minutes. Then having raced through security, there was the almost inevitable flight delay, only this time the 40-minute delay to the incoming aircraft was a result, we were told, of someone forgetting to tow the plane on to the stand from another part of the airport! With flights taking off to the west, there was yet another 20 minutes delay during taxiing. Only crisps or a couple of sweet biscuits were offered along with drinks.

The seats were cramped, food was not at all tasty and the plane from Istanbul to Brussels had a very small screen. The flights never took off on time, were delayed by an half an hour to an hour.

Window and aisle going over and middle section back YVR-HNL-YVR. In fact the middle seats were better with room. The inflight entertainment system is a joke even as I knew to download the app on my iPad but the movies and all others were old ""vintage"" movies from 10-20 years ago! I will do my utmost to avoid Rouge in future even for my ""leisure"" travel. Friends of ours were stuck in Barcelona for 9 hours due to a aircraft issue in June 2015 and co-worker was stuck in HNL for same amount of time due to same reason, I see in thread this seems to be a recurring theme (maybe the aircraft are getting to old that have been taken off the main line of AC to support Rouge).

We went to the BOA office in La Paz and were able to rebook without change fees. Only paid the fare difference. Finally flew out on the 18th but had a several hour delay out of La Paz. While this was not handled all that well by the ground staff this seemed to be par for the course - every other flight we have been on this year (in the USA) has had delays. Boarding was easy. Once the flight was announced, everyone just lined up and boarded. None of the convuluted boarding typical of airlines in the US and it only took about 15 minutes to board the plane. Since checked bags are free, there was no hassle for overhead space. Plane was economy class only with decent seat pitch. No extra charge to choose seats. Despite being a short flight, cabin crew came around with a complementary snack box and beverages. Plane was an older 737 but in reasonable shape and clean - I have flown in much more dilapidated planes on the legacy carriers. We had made a mistake on our booking for the return but were able to call BOA and rebook for the next day. Again, only paid the fare difference, in this case about US$8 each. Return flights (with connection in Cochabamba) were on time and the crew managed a snack service with drinks on the 35 minute flight from Cochabamba to La Paz. On the shorter flight from Sucre to Cochabamba they handed out snack packs to everyone. All in all a very good experience. Crews and ground staff generally pleasant and efficient. No ""gotcha"" fees and the fare was very reasonable. A nice change to what seems to be the general experience flying nowadays. Recommended.",Economy,8

Same friendly service on board for the return trip. The aircraft used is the smaller version of the ATRs they have in their fleet but offers the same cabin layout as the bigger ATR aircraft, the seat pitch is exactly the same. This is Aurigny's newest route and is a great alternative to Gatwick and would highly recommend this for anyone starting or finishing their journey in central London.

Seat was ok, not full flat, but quite comfy. IFE very poor, only 5 channels available, showing only 2 movies in Spanish/English version, no Air Show with a map available, so had no idea about flight time etc. Cabin crew were nice and smiling, quite senior and during breakfast service, looking very tired and grumpy. Disappointing menu - I was expecting some local dishes from Argentina, some beef etc, and I got green salad with parma ham, risotto or pork with ratatuille or ravioli. I tried first two - all tasted the same, bland, boring, over cooked. No cocktail service at all, as only whisky is available. Good wines. Service in business class is very old fashioned, reminds me service from the 90s, nothing modern as for plating, food presentation, menu etc. Dirty toilet in Business Class.

On these flights however, there wasn't an empty seat on the plane, either way and of course I had a very large ""companion"" in the middle seat. Really it did not feel much different from the regular economy, but at least I did not have to pay any extras. I note that Westjet are going to stop selling the middle seat. Too bad they haven't implemented that already. I was hoping for some level of improved comfort for the extra money, but really I was just crammed in like everyone else. Food is the same as regular economy, and nothing to get excited about: limp sandwiches and junk food snacks. Wine was drinkable. On the return flight, the aircraft had no seat back entertainment, instead they were renting out tablets (much like AC Rouge). This was, of course, free in Plus. Choices on the tablet were minimal.

Why couldn't they have checked the plane beforehand so that 1) we could've left on time, 2) we could've taken another aircraft, 3) or at least if neither of those options were possible, we could have waited in the terminal where we could at least walk around and get food. There were no compensations of any kind made by the airline to their customers, the only reason I don't give the airline a 0/10 review is because their on-the-ground-workers were swift in helping people get to their next connecting flight.",Economy,1

This was 12.55 and the plane was schedule to leave at 1.45, needless to say it would be a delayed flight. When It was my turn to board they said I had to put my carry-on luggage in the hold because they had no more space. The flight was crowded and disorganized.

A surprise because at check in no one had informed us. The captain of the plane did not inform us and apologized over the intercom that the plane had to make a stopover in Lisbon. During the trip from Chisinau to Lisbon the crew gave us a sandwich for lunch and a drink. The stopover in Lisbon was nearly two hours, the crew did not give us anything to drink. On the way from Lisbon to Barcelona the crew did not give us anything to eat, and they did not have any still drinking water.

We ordered water and tea countless times until they finally responded, the inflight entertainment in my opinion is not good. There wasn't enough variety in the choice of food. When we bought the tickets they advertised it as a plane that has WiFi, which was not the case. The plane was old, the seats were tiny and not comfortable at all.

As an single traveller, 6""4, it's not the most comfortable way of traveling. When I came on board and saw where I was seated this man asked me to change places with his wife so they could sit together. That is no problem for me, I'm pretty flexible so I helped them out. Now I sat in the middle block, had 2 seats next to me that were free. So giving up my seat wasn't a bad decision at all. I figured I could sleep well when I moved one seat up. 15mins in, the stewardess comes to me and asks me friendly if I could change seats with an older couple. I decided to give up my seat again for these people. The stewardess promised me that the seats there were as good as this one I was sitting in, except the one screen wasn't working where the man sat. We switched places and then I found out that my headphones were not working properly. Only my right earphone worked. Since the other screen wasn't working I was stuck. A little annoyed I got out of my seat again and walked up to the flight attendant who asked me to change seats. All she offered was the headphones they provide onboard, she said she would come to me in a minute. After almost an hour of waiting I had to go back to her. I ended up with some cheese and crackers, grapes and a cup of peanuts, one headphone working and a terrible feeling for letting me change my seat for other people.

I spent a week in Tuscany minus any change of clothing, trying to locate the luggage by phoning frequently (several Italian speaking friends also helped me by trying to connect with customer service), to no avail. I was in a remote area, so could not even shop for essentials. When someone finally answered the phone they had no knowledge as to where my suitcase was.

SAS charge you like a full-service carrier but offer low cost service. To me there is really no difference between SAS and Ryanair appart from the fact that SAS let's you check a bag for ""free"". Water, snacks, beverages (except coffee and tea) are priced rather heavily . Would advise anyone to buy it at the airport and bring it onboard. Flight attendants pleasant from GOT-NCE. On the return flight the crew consisted of the typical disinterested older ladies, one of which was downright rude. They hid in the galley for most of the trip. Seats were comfortable for a 2,5 hrs flight and the online check-in with mobile boaring passes worked really well. Both flights arrived on time. Due to previous experiences with SAS, I haven't flown them for quite some time. And I won't be for the near future either. Spend your money elsewhere.

When I arrive in Shanghai it was even worse. The ground staff did not speak English, no one could help me or tell me where should I go to change my flight to Beijing. I had to pick up my luggage and find the check in counters and someone who can guide. Staff had limited English skills in a large international airport and I had to consult about 6 counter desks without any positive response. Finally I was booked in the next flight. And while waiting the staff at the business lounge told me that my flight did not have a time of departure and offered me to change me in another flight 1 hours after!  No one could ensure if my luggage will be changed to the new flight even. As I said really the worse airline ever.

Air Canada Boeing 787 cabin was clean and felt open with the lighting and larger windows. I was surprised at the amount of leg room there was in an economy seat, as so many people have stated it was poor. My knees did touch the seat in front of myself however I was able to extend them under the seat with no problem. My wife being much shorter had plenty of room. I would suggest when travelling with an infant to take advantage of the bassinet seat as we did on the return flight. The seats are slightly narrow. The inflight entertainent was great having your own personal screen to watch numerous movies and TV shows. The only issue with these is that there is a ""remote"" control located on the arm rests. The buttons are usually pressed by the person sitting beside you which will cause your seat light and functions on the entertainment screen to be activated (sucks when watching a movies and volume keeps going up and down). The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful and service with a smile. Our first flight they even attempted to have people give up the bassinet seat to allow us to sit there.

BKK-AUH was ok as I slept the trip in Biz class though the configuration of the Jet Airways business class is a bit odd. Everyone is pointing sideways. AUH-FCO operated by Alitalia wasn’t as pleasant. Staff seemed clearly unhappy and stressed out. At the end of a cartoonish safety video that ends with the phrase “your crew is perfectly trained” the Captain announced in English “Cabin staff get ready for landing” as we were still waiting at the foot of the runway for take-off. I had to contact by phone Etihad’s 24 hour help center, besides not being particularly friendly or polite, they didn’t understand the problem I had and finally left me hanging on the phone until the system cut me off. This happened twice. Because the issue surrounded a 6 + 11 hour delay and because the flight originated from Europe where consumer rights state that any flight with a delay greater than 5 hours may be refunded I was able to change carriers and fly back with a different company.

611,british-airways,Eamon Callan,2015-07-28,"I have flown in business class with BA on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. If you get an indifferent crew - which, in my experience, is not far off half the time - they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible, go to sleep and not bother them any more. Once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and leave you to ask for everything. I have never had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example Emirates, EVA or Lan Chile, quite the opposite. Anyway, BA were offering a special price to upgrade (cash only) to first on my Vancouver-Heathrow flight. I thought I'd try it. It was a waste of money. The first sign of trouble was the fact that I was not welcomed or addressed by name - an absolute must I think. Then the (male, and they tend to be the worst on BA, I am sorry to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy - he just doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in a personal manner. The wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when I asked a specific question (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know the answer. I eat slowly and was still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. I thought 'Oh no, surely not in first'. Well, I was wrong. I was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. After that, unbelievably, I was abandoned again and, in protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. I asked to speak to the cabin services director (female, delighful manner) who was full of apologies, of course, and off I went back to my seat. When I was finally given coffee, the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that BA don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do, I couldn't believe my ears. As for the cabin, being in the nose of the 747,I felt cramped. The mood-changing lighting doesn't compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats and carpet. The in-light entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. I know this reads like a demolition job on BA but I have made no exaggerations. I really think Willie Walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. He'd find out for himself. I want BA to be the best and it simply isn't. Lastly, my experience of the hit and miss service of BA business class is shared by every other person I have ever mentioned it to.

630,sas-scandinavian-airlines,Jeff Robinson,2015-07-20,"We flew round trip coach from San Francisco to Copenhagen and bought our tickets 7 months in advance for $1,450 each. There were 12 of us flying under 3 separate reservations. Customer service over the phone was marginal depending on who you got, sometimes they were friendly, other times either too busy to care or rude. Check in was fast, friendly and efficient. Mechanical issues prevented us from boarding the plane and we were four hours delayed from departure. There was a mild apology given by the captain but not any discounts nor free drinks on the flight. Our plane seemed dated but was clean. Individual entertainment systems on the back of each seat are the worst I’ve experienced. Only a third of the published opportunities worked and the movies are on a loop with no pause nor start. Audio was terrible. Food quality was far less than average. The flight was smooth and we arrived at our destination safely. Return: Pre-flight online check-in was easier for our group. At the Copenhagen terminal once inside, it was not easy to understand what line to enter to begin your process as their signage could be improved. Boarding was efficient and on time. This plane appeared to be even older than the first one. I believe it was an Airbus A340? Entertainment systems and screen illumination were even worse than our first flight! Food was awful. But on the other side the service was good (if that even helps). A very long flight of almost 11 hours, all during daylight. I was not satisfied with our experience and I thought it was poor value.",Economy,2

632,air-china,W Shevon,2015-07-13,"Usually I fly Etihad for Geneva - Chengdu route, therefore I can't help but comparing the 2 airlines. Both are national carrier of their respective countries, however, the difference is obvious. I just want to mention some main points: 1) The crews are not really warm nor patient, which happens to almost all Air China flights I have taken. I am not sure whether it's because majority of the passengers are Chinese. I am not going comment on the behavior of the passengers themselves, as a service provider, the least you have to do is smile and be courteous. On the other hand, I can't say all Etihad crews are excellent, but I have encountered some who are really sincere and hospitable. 2) The entertainment system is really outdated, the control is not sensible any more and the movies are really lame. On the contrary, Etihad has a great selection of movies and easy to use system. Besides, it has considerably provided each passenger a small pouch with an eye mask, a toothbrush with toothpaste, a pair of ear plugs plus a pair of socks. I suggest Air China to have more trainings on the attitude of their cabin crews and how to provide exceptional customer service.",Economy,5

The check in counters were not open when we arrived at the airport, and when they did open the self-checkout ""helper"" had no idea how to help us and sent us to a counter. My traveling companion was told that she had a standby seat, even though we booked months in advance. It took the staff 30 minutes to figure out how to get her a seat, and instead of reassuring us they were flirting and chatting the whole time. Even though we booked our flight together, we were not seated together and when I asked to switch seats the staff very rudely told me no, that the flight was full, too bad. We had heard of an exit refund for passengers flying out of Colombia, but when we asked several staff members they pretended they didn't understand even though they had been speaking English to us seconds earlier.

On the first leg, nice crew, good tasty sandwich and drink, old but good airplane which was clean, priority boarding with infants respected, all-in-all positive experience and would fly with them again. On the return leg, TAP Portugal's Porto ground staff decided to ruin my day. I am a Star Alliance silver member and should have had no issue with luggage. But for some reason they now told me that my two bags were overweight (30 instead of 23 kg) and that I had to pay 50 EUR each supplement to carry them to BRU, even though I had exactly the same amount of luggage going to OPO, this apparently did not matter. They even told me to go and buy another suitcase, they would be able to accept it free of charge if less than 23kg. Given the fact that I was traveling with three children one of which is a toddler not really an option. But even if, there are no suitcases for sale at OPO so would not have been an option anyway. Talking to the manager did not help either so had to pay. I was told I could complain in BRU but was also told that it would have no effect. That was true because in BRU there was no one even willing to register my complaint. I tried later through the internet but guess what, 3 weeks have passed and still no reply. As for the return flight itself, it was just as good as the one coming into OPO. So a real pity, a nice product but ruined by some ground staff in OPO and some very restrictive rules on luggage.

The return flight, when we got to the airport they had changed the plane, we purposely booked that specific flight because it had a A330 on it and it was changed to a A310, the reason we booked that flight as it has the in seat entertainment system on the A330 but not on the ancient A310's they are flying.

When Checking in they tried to charge me for baggage again although already paid for. When I  spoke to them on the phone, they just tried to fob me off to other numbers even though I called the Customer Service number.

He disappeared and never came back. Finally after the meal we got someone to come and they forced the seat to recline but it never worked properly. The seats are nowhere near lie-flat and are quite uncomfortable. There was a limited range of movies and hardly any TV programmes. How hard is to offer a decent range of entertainment? The food was mediocre and seemed the same as you get in Economy. The breakfast was terrible – a hard, fully cooked egg that was called poached on a tough muffin. We were never offered the bread basket. The steward walked straight past us. We had the same disinterested service on our next flight on a 777-300. The food was a bit better but not great. There were no snacks offered overnight. The staff seemed more interested in serving dinner quickly so they could spend the rest of the flight resting and chatting. And seats were even worse.

During the flight they were very attentive and when called there were no grumpy faces! In terms of entertainment, I don't think any airline can beat Emirates' ICE entertainment system. It's fantastic and you'd never get bored with their selection of movies offered on their enormous screens (bigger than your standard iPad!). Loved their on board cameras too. Seats and legroom on the A380 are great - by far better than their cramped 777s! The plane was also only half full so I had 2 spare seats next to me. The food was good although I wasn't very hungry and didn't finish it all but needless to say there was plenty, not to mention the extra snacks offered on board. Emirates also give you real cutlery not plastic ones. Only downside is that toilets got quite dirty and weren't taken care of by the crew (but this of course is also down to careless passengers) and WIFI didn't work properly though with all of the above, you forgot it was even there.

In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board.

Condor doesn't have a bag drop option in Calgary we had to stand in the checkin line for 45 mins even though we were checked in. It was the first flight of the year from Calgary so once fully boarded we sat in the plane for an hour because the contracted ground handler didn't train their staff on condors systems. The pilot told us such. Once enroute the flight was fine. Entertainment was one free basic movie and then a small fee to access the premium content. Overall selection was mediocre.

The food served was also average which there was no option not to pay for as with other airlines, something I like being a lower base fare. Movie and entertainment selection was good, but didn't change the comfort levels much during flight.

Two of these flights had delays of 45 and 40 minutes sitting on the tarmac waiting to get off the planes.  On one of these flights, the seating was cramped and the cabin was hot.

We were given a terrible chicken meal at lunch and then nothing until the equivalent of 11pm (for the passengers' day), when we received sub standard sandwiches. We have never experienced an international flight like it. Additionally, the entertainment systems were problematic in that the touch screen was not sensitive enough and had to be pressed repeatedly.

Food and drink good and free, a bonus. Cabin attendants, an older purser up front a bit patronising. The two in economy were really going through the motions, no eye contact and perfunctory service. 1 drink served in a 2.5 hour flight.

Flight attendants were American and very good. Pilots were British and that is always reassuring. A few minor negatives such as: Lounge at JFK not good (Korean Air) and some of the ground staff at London Gatwick not good. Overall a superb experience and very good value for money.

Service quality by the staff (attitude, promptness and helpfulness) was 4 out of 5. As for meals I was highly impressed because of their setting.  Metal cutlery (not plastic), menu to read, delicate desserts, and nice dishware. Other than that, the food is OK, the dinner being good while breakfast was  poor.

Then the agent concerned to add insult to injury upgraded her friends who were on the flight in front of me at the boarding gate. The cabin crew were rude, surly, and never smiled once during the flight. On the flight the on-board service was rubbish, just fell short of them throwing the food at you. The pre purchased hot meal was over cooked which meant most of the meal was wasted. The cabin crew were a total let down to the airline. However the return flight was different and I cannot praise the cabin crew highly enough, they were friendly, and could not do enough for you. The pre ordered food was excellent and the cabin service was slick and efficient. On the return there were regular updates from the cockpit - outbound there were none only the internal messages to the crew. My advice is be careful when booking as the flight arrival times in Riga can make the outward travel in Latvia expensive or may mean an overnight stop in Riga. Also the airlines fleet of Boeing 737 is fairly old with an average airfame age of 11 years.

First we were told we would be leaving 20 min late from 3.30 to 3.50 due to mechanical issue then about an hr after that they delayed us 4 more hrs for the same issue then an 1 hr later after that we were told the plane was on approach, surprised to hear that so now it was an hr and 15 min that from the original time promised. After fumbling around the cockpit for another 30 min after boarding and sitting on an empty runway we are told we are wait for 2 aircrafts to land. No one landed the on the runway. We take off finally after sitting there for another 20 min on the runway. We land in Fort Lauderdale and our connecting flight from there left 18 mins before we landed. This left us high and dry. Spirit gave us an 'I really don't care attitude' when they came back with no real solution except for a flight out the next day that went to several stops up to Detroit, Chicago and then finally to Dallas 7 hrs later. It would have left at 12 noon and landed in Dallas after 11pm. We had to pay $450 for 2 tickets on American which worked flawlessly.",nan,1
722,etihad-airways,M Lee,2015-06-12,"Had two journeys with Etihad within 3 weeks and neither was satisfying. As I was travelling with a family member who is wheelchair bound, we requested to be provided special assistance. There was a ground staff assigned to help us when we landed in Abu Dhabi from Kuala Lumpur.  He simply pushed my wheelchair bound family member as if it was a 100m sprint. Later we had to line up to cross security check, however he led us to cut the line which the security officer was not agreeable to and everything was such a mess and the experience was so unpleasant.  The flight attendant was impolite as well. On the flight, there were a group of travelers that seemed new to flying. One of them was struggling to adjust his inclined seat while the stewardess spotted him. At first the stewardess asked him politely to adjust the seat. The man answered that he had already adjusted the seat by pressing the button. At the end of the situation, it was realized that the adjustment button was not functioning well, however the stewardess did not change her attitude. On the journey back to Kuala Lumpur, the flight from London to Abu Dhabi was delayed and caused me to miss the transit flight. There was a group of 20+ of us from the same flight stranded. The airline arranged a hotel for us, inclusive of shuttle and meals.  However, the arrangement was poorly done. Little assistant nor direction was given and after we cleared custom, we were just left waiting in the lobby. It took 2 hours for the airline to arrange the shuttle to send us to the hotel and by the time we reached, it was already past 4am! Similar poor coordination during the pick up from the hotel as there were 2 sedan cars picking up 8 designated passengers and later the same shuttle bus arrived. We had all boarded the bus but the driver would not leave the hotel as he was told to pick up 21 passengers and 8 were missing (obviously picked up by the earlier sedan cars).",Economy,2

My family and I just sat back and relaxed on Qantas, following a multitude extremely rude bumbling incompetence by Emirates that saw us stranded in Dubai for almost a day. Once again the helpful, friendly and professional Qantas staff in Australia went above and beyond to resolve the Emirates problems we had encountered. Qantas staff were both on the ground and in the air very friendly and professional. Food, drinks and service excellent during the flights, the Business Class flatbeds allowed for comfortable sleep for the 9.5 hour journey. A little bit more variety with the onboard movies I think would help particularly when travelling with children, however not a bad selection overall. We have generally always flown Qantas, however with the code-sharing between Qantas and Emirates these days, sometimes you end up actually on an Emirates flight. ",Business,10

As a Star Alliance Gold passenger I was able to use the business check-in which took less than 1 minute. The agent was not sure which lounge to send me to - I have a Turkish Gold Card. Eventually I chose the SAS Business Lounge, which is one of the better Star Alliance Gold lounges at O'hare T5. It has slightly better food with excellent views of the apron and runway. Don't use the Swissport Lounge. The fight departs on time. B737-800 has the interior almost identical to a United aircraft. It's an old plane - things are a little frayed and worn but not falling apart. Seat pitch is a little tight, comparable to US airlines. There was no IFE but drop down monitors every 3 rows and free headphones were handed out. On this 5 hour flight, dinner was served 1 hour after take off. There was no choice for entree, which was a layer of cheesy baked mashed potatoes on top of seasoned sauteeed ground beef with vegetables. It was quite good in fact but portion was small. Basic uninspiring salad, packaged dessert. As usual, alcohol is free (whisky, beer, red wine, white wine). Flight attendants served several rounds of water throughout the flight but there was no refreshment service before landing. No newspaper service, no hot towels. Flight attendants seem to be professional and pleasant. Overall it's slightly better than US airlines but far below Asian carriers in economy on comparable routes in both amenities and comfort. If you're able to get a good deal on Copa then I'd recommend flying it.",Economy,7

The A330 is uncomfortable in economy. When the seat in front of you is reclined, you have the tray table pitted against you stomach, even if you are not fat. The flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the A330. Rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally. One must slide to the end and climb out. I have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in Economy - horrible. Considering how packed the flight was, the flight attendants were excellent. The food was mediocre with two choices: pasta or beef, and very small servings. Flight attendants provided drinks generously and water service was available throughout the flight. Bathrooms were kept fairly clean. Movie selection was very good, free headphones were provided.

We then found out from other passengers that the flight was cancelled and that all passengers were rebooked on a flight leaving 2 days later (on Monday night, June 1). We then discovered that the rescheduled flight was delayed until Tuesday morning, June 2. I called Norwegian's customer service number and after waiting on hold for 1 hour and 55 minutes, spoke to a rude service representative who said my only options were to cancel, or to go on my trip 3 days later than the orginal departure date. I asked to be rescheduled on an alternate carrier, a 3 day delay being utterly ridiculous. The representative told me that would not be possible. She said that Norwegian would put us up in a hotel at Oakland Airport and would issue a $20 per person meal allowance. She refused to let me speak to a supervisor and would not disclose the reason why. She then proceeded to hang up on me. In my 40 years of air travel, I have yet to encounter anything like this.

BA should be commended for retaining 9-abreat seating in the 777, legroom is adequate and adjustable headrest is a nice touch. AVOD was decent, with clear screen, though movie selection was not extensive. Catering was marginal on the outbound flight from Atlanta, with breakfast ""croissant"" being inedible, however, much better on the inbound flight from London. Cabin crew were professional, but utterly aloof, interacting with the passengers without the slightest hint of warmth.

Virgin reception staff rather uptight, but the dining area staff was outstanding. All four flight segments were not full, so I had an empty seat next to me at all times. This is a huge benefit, as although the
seat has an outstanding pitch, is wide and very comfortable, it dates back to business class seating of a decade ago, with zero privacy between seats if you are travelling alone. A small bottle of water and a nice Georgio Amani amenity kit was awaiting my arrival, with a blanket, pillow and noise-cancelling headphones. Pyjamas and slippers were given out later on the segments to/from IAD. Staff service was very good on all segments and dine when you want service was good, though cutbacks are very evident in their menus. Of the four flight segments, QR 707 from DOH to IAD on 01 June had excellent crew serving the rear business class cabin where I was. Transit time was short at DOH, but the airport does not function logically, despite its showy architecture. Certainly no match for SIN and HKG. Check-in at CMB was efficient, and I used the UL Serendib Lounge due to my OW Emerald Tier status. Mid-week QR fare was very competitive, and provided very good value for money.

The flight after ours (also Cusco-Lima, scheduled for one hour later) was also delayed due to mechanical problems. The captain would not release the plane for the flight. We were ultimately delayed for almost 5 hours. Meanwhile, Star Peru had a flight on the same Cusco-Lima route leaving every hour, and all of those flights got to go while we waited and waited. People were missing their connecting flights, and no one would help us or give us any info. Apart from what seemed like pretty significant maintenance issues, the airline appeared to be badly short-staffed. Even though there was one flight every hour going to Lima, we only ever saw four Star Peru employees at the airport. Communication between these employees and the inflight staff was apparently also a problem because no one had any idea what was going on, as far as we could tell. They gave out no information unless we specifically asked for it. We were told the flight was delayed 15 minutes. Then another 15 minutes, then an hour, then another hour. It was really frustrating, and the staff seemed to have nothing to offer, not even sympathy.

Don't expect anyone to be at the counter if you arrived 2 hours before your flight is supposed to leave.

The lie flat bed in business was excellent. Much more spacious than the United product or the Smartium business bed on Asiana and others. The layout of the seats is a bit different - less privacy but more open feeling and real space. Comfy duvet and blankets provided on this night flight. Cabin crew although older (55+) were very well trained, warm, polite and efficient. They came around repeatedly talking to the passengers and making sure we were comfortable and seemed to genuinely care. In fact their efforts helped overcame the other deficiencies in the hard product. Compared to the brusque automatons on United these folks were full of smiles and eager to please. Also the Indian food selection was delicious. The negatives: compared to the premium airlines AI is clearly not as polished or well organized. Meals were provided all at once in a single tray - not course by course as on other airlines. Menus was not provided. Wine choice was very limited. Champagne was served lukewarm. After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away. Movie selection though limited was not as bad as I had imagined. It would be nice to have served a quick snack or wake-up drink prior to landing.

755,condor-airlines,Richard Parker,2015-07-21,"I am used to flying business class with the traditional big carriers when flying internationally (Air Canada, Lufthansa) so I was unsure what to expect when flying with Condor. I was headed to Nice to attend a friends wedding and had enough miles to get there for free via Lufthansa but was short a few thousand for the return. Condor offered a great fare for business and I figured because it was affiliated with Lufthansa it wouldn't be so bad. For the most part I was right. When I arrived in Frankfurt from Nice it took at least 20 minutes to get to the gate. Not a problem since I had a 4 hour layover. However there were no food options in the terminal (minus a duty free and some vending machines) so we had to exit the terminal and go back through security to get to an area where we could eat. Luckily we didn't have to go back through immigration. After eating we went back to the gate and were greeted with a long line. Unbeknownst to me or my friends we had to go through security again, before we could enter the actual gate area. There was no separate line for business class passengers and once through security, there was a Condor check in process that added another 10 minutes before you could actually grab a seat at the gate. Once in the gate area, there is a small store where you can buy water and chips but not much else. Not a deal breaker. We finally boarded and they let business class passengers board first. As we walked onto the plane I noticed that it wasn't an actual Condor plane. It was a 757 that belonged to Eastern (I think). It appears Condor rents the plane but uses their own crew. The cabin layout was 2-3-2 throughout. All seats appeared to be the same width but Business Class had more pitch. I'm about 5'10 and could stretch my feet out comfortably. Although it sold as Business Class it was more like premium economy in my opinion. The seats were not lie flat, but at the ticket price, I won't complain. I could tell that the plane was old and refitted. There was no entertainment system in the seat back which annoyed me. As we were taking off, I could really tell that we were in an old plane. I fly weekly for work, so I know a smooth take-off vs a rough one. This was a rough take off and the screen on the bulk head actually showed us losing altitude at some point. Can't lie I was a tad nervous. We finally hit 10,000 feet and things started to get better. The cabin crew came by and gave everyone in Business Class a portable entertainment system to compensate for it not being in the seat back. They were kind of bulky (think a portable playstation) but the movie selection was great and so was the quality. It was free for Business Class but I think there was a nominal fee for everyone else. The food selection was good enough. I wasn't expecting 5 star dining, but the lunch was tasty and filling and the cabin crew was very attentive and helpful. I fell asleep for half of the flight and woke up for the second serving which was also tasty and filling. All in all it was a pleasurable experience given the price I paid for my ticket. I would fly with them again, but only if its on one of their aircraft, and not one that they lease.",Business,6

757,vietnam-airlines,Anthika Tran,2015-07-11,Warning to travellers with excess baggage. You need a registered email to purchase pre-paid baggage online. If you have booked through a travel agent they may not have registered your email address. I got caught by this and had to pay $14 per kg at check-in instead of paying much less to purchase online. The manager at the Vietnam Airlines counter handled this appallingly and it was a terrible experience.,Economy,3
758,vietnam-airlines,Brian Lamprell,2015-07-29,"SYD-SGN on Vietnam Airlines because of the 8 hour flying time compared to 13-15 hours travelling time for its competitors. Check in was terribly slow, mainly due to the high percentage of passengers who had 3 or 4 large cartons as excess baggage. It all has to be weighed and labelled and that takes time. On boarding, the cabin crew pointed us unsmilingly towards our seats. The A330-200 looked in good condition with the cabin clean and tidy. We asked for extra seats at check-in so we could stretch out and had 4 seats to ourselves. In the rear cabin section there were only about 30 passengers. With the seat-belt sign illuminated the crew made no attempt to check the passengers or items on seats. While the A330 was waiting to enter the runway, the woman sitting in front of us stood up and walked to the rear toilet. The two cabin crew looking at her frowned but said and did nothing to stop her. During the flight, the seat belt sign was illuminated and passengers told to belt up as there was turbulence ahead. The flight smoothed out but the sign stayed on for over an hour but some passengers took no notice and moved around the cabin without challenge. The PTV selection is limited but passable, however my unit locked up and none of the controls would fix it. After a frustrating ten minutes I reported it to the cabin crew who advised me to change seats. Okay, but later my wife’s PTV also locked, but later went into re-boot and after several minutes, the programs returned, but the screen was still locked. Food served during the flight was edible. The toilets used by us were in poor condition. Floors wet, dirty stains under the seats, damaged fascia around the mirror, toilet seat and cover broken away from its mountings and tissues on the floor. We didn't see cabin attendant refresh or tidy toilets. On the final approach to Saigon, with the seat belt sign illuminated, passengers still moved about the cabin uncontested by the crew. Of the attendants who worked our part of the cabin, only one was smiling, and she kept it up all the flight. All in all, a very deficient performance from a somewhat surly cabin crew and poor maintenance, particularly the toilets.",Economy,3

Transiting Doha is now much better with the new terminal. And even better if you have a silver card as you get access to a lounge in Entebbe and Doha.

The seats should have been replaced years ago by the time we got off the aircraft 5 hours later my wife and I could barley walk. Coming back and go to drop off the bags they had 6 lines going and one attendant, get our boarding passes and they had us divided up all over the aircraft, talked to the gate attendant his response we have been paging you and was very rude with us.

What used to happen in my day when a person of 6ft 5ins boarded a plane there was consideration and care? Now it is all about extra money! I distinctly remember when this situation arose we would kindly ask smaller exit seated passengers to swap and 9 times out of ten people would be happy to do so. We maybe would offer a few drinks in return and everyone was happy. My son who is 6ft 5in was like a caged animal on our recent American Airlines flight, 10 hours of absolute hell. Yes we could have paid more for an exit seat but he is a student and this was not an option. While shorter passengers get seats for less he is now faced with either having to pay more to travel than shorter people or not travel at all. It is not as if he can do anything about his height, if he was simply overweight – then he could diet – but this is not the case. American Airlines allowed him to stand up all the way from LA to LHR for 10 hours, when he had to sit his legs had to be wide apart and any chance of a brace position would be completely ruled out. American Airlines – shame on you for your greed! I am not sure why trolleys were used for the meal service – they could have just chucked boxes of junk down the cabin and asked those interested to catch them. ",Economy,1

No english newspapers. We had a little boy with us (8 years old) and when his mother asked for a pillow and blanket, only 2 pillows where found in the whole plane and 2 blankets. We waited a long time until food service started, even economy passengers in back of us got service before us. We were served 20 min later. As I said before the seats were very uncomfortable and as I am not a small man I could not put the tray all the way down because the legroom between the seats was not that much. 7th July 2015, Frankfurt to Keflavik Iceland, flight LH856. The same poor quality seats. We asked for a pillow and a blanket but there was only one blanket and no pillows in the whole plane. The reason we were given was that the plane came in over night and all blankets and pillows were used! The stewardess onboard was very nice and tried to calm me down, the reason she said that the seats weren´t better than this was that the flight was short haul. I fly all over Europe at least 15 times a year and everywhere, the Business Class has better seats. ",Business,2
799,virgin-australia,Boris To,2015-07-26,"I bought a ticket to fly from Sydney to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi with Air Berlin. The first leg from Sydney to Abu Dhabi was operated by Virgin Australia. I have flown overseas multiple times with other airlines, a couple of times to Germany too. All of them gave me the option to increase my baggage limit by paying extra before the flight (you get charged a lot more per kg on the day at the airport otherwise). Virgin Australia tells me that I do not have the option to do that. Even budget airlines gave me the option increase baggage limit up to 50kg. In the light of Virgin's rather positive reputation, I think this is highly unsatisfactory and they certainly do not live up to their reputation. (For goodness sake, I was even willing to pay extra to increase the limit; I was not asking for a freebie. They are hopeless.) I was also disgusted by Virgin and AirBerlin trying to ""pass the ball"" between themselves for an eternity, not taking any responsibility or care. It is just poor customer service, poor work ethics. Some staff over the phone were also rude and impatient, but let's not even go there. Never am I going to have anything to do with Virgin again.",Economy,1

818,virgin-atlantic-airways,J Warren,2015-07-27,"LGW-CUN-LGW. Having previously flown Virgin, we were very much looking forward to this trip and we were not disappointed! Both flights were served by the airline's refreshed boeing 747's, and they were very comfortable to fly in - the new economy seats on this aircraft are without a doubt some of the most comfortable we have ever used on long haul. However, I did notice that both planes seemed to echo an eerie sense of flying back in the 1980s/90s, despite them both having been refreshed - eg: old style overhead fittings and noisy cabins. Moreover, the touch screen IFE was quite tedious to use, depite it's generous offering of films and music. I would suggest that the airline deploy their newer airbus A330-300s on more of their Gatwick routes, as they are, in contrast, quieter, more modern and comfortable. However, both sectors had excellent crews who were eager to engage with their passengers, and it was clear that they took a pleasure in their duties. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Virgin have retained some thoughtful touches, such as amenity kits. However, the meal service is a big let down. The catering quality is fine, but portions do need to be bigger, especially on a long flight of 11 hours. Moreover, the snack service could also be revamped, as it is still very limited and has not improved since our last flight with Virgin two years ago. Clearly, the Virgin Atlantic economy experience delivers a solid product, but still leaves room open for improvement. We would certainly consider flying the airline again, but would try to avoid flying the 747 in favour of the airbus A330-300, due to it's enhanced comfort.",Economy,7

820,spirit-airlines,Aaron Wortham,2015-07-29,"I'm extremely unimpressed with Spirit Airlines. I understand that they're trying to be a low cost budget airline, but I still believe that it's reasonable to expect some level of competency. First, the flight really isn't that much cheaper, if it is cheaper at all. You have to pay for every piece of luggage (except for 1 backpack), plus seats if you don't want a random seat, and drinks (including water). If you're 6'4"" like me, the only seats that really fit you are the exit row seats, which run you between $20 and $40. One checked bag is $40 per trip (which was actually cheaper than bringing a carry-on for the flight I took). Plus drinks are another $2-4. Which means, if you have a lay-over and you're doing a round-trip, you'll be spending about $100 more for the flight, which makes it just as expensive as any other airline that isn't trying to be ultra-budget (at least for the flight I took). Combine the cost with the fact that they had to cancel one of my connecting flights, making me a whole day late, and top it all off with their really annoying advertising, and what you'll get is a very annoying trip. My recomendation: don't fly Spirit. ",Economy,1

The way the United Airlines handled my partner's luggage that was left behind at our originating destination was a stressful start to our trip. Upon arriving at the airport around 5.45pm to catch our 8.20pm flight, flight 5237, from Sacramento to Los Angeles, on Monday July 20 2015, we checked in promptly and breezed through security. We sat by the gate with a plane that sat there for as long as we had, little did we know this was our plane. By the time boarding came around, our flight was delayed for another hour, occurring multiple times for the next few hours. It was my hope that during the initial delay the service desk would help customers explore other options to reach connecting flights and/or destinations to avoid delays or issues upon arriving in Los Angeles. We were worried about missing our connecting flight the entire time. The second delay hits and people began to be frantic and changed flights. My party and I anxiously wondered if we were going to make our connecting flight or if we needed to rebook online. We called customer service a few times to inquire about alternative options but were never offered alternatives until hours later right before the last delay was lifted after 11am and needed to quickly decide on either taking the flight or flying out of another airport. I am baffled at the lack of customer service. My second and major complaint was the issue with our checked luggage getting left behind in Sacramento as we made our way to Cancun.

I got a message on my phone that my connecting flight had already departed and re- booked me on a 2.15 pm flight the next day. When I finally got to talk to a customer representative I told her my situation and that I had to get to Detroit, she was kind enough to book me on an American Airlines flight.

I am 6'6"" tall and must have legroom - had to work very hard to get it! Was promised premium services on flight (welcome drinks, in-flight drinks, special meals, amenity kit, headphones etc.) none of which transpired. Staff on outbound flight very nice and  did what they could to accommodate us - managed to arrange two legroom seats side by side, for instance. Long noisy flight, drunk rowdy passengers behind us. Food very poor - though recommended by 'celebrity chef James Martin'. Return flight less noisy, couldn't sleep though. Staff much less helpful, talked among themselves, didn't offer much service - threw breakfast at passengers without warning us to set our tables etc.! They were surly and unwelcoming. Flights were smooth, pilots kept us aware of where we were, conditions at destination etc. Seats were very uncomfortable for a long flight and crew had closed access to front lavatories, so there were too few available for customers. My complaints about lack of notice of change and great disappointment with the different experience than that I was expecting have all been ignored by Customer Services - not even an acknowledgement!

So what do you want to do?"" Excuse me? After waiting another 10 mins for the supervisor, my son was put on a stand by list for the next flight in the afternoon, not Saturday! So in the afternoon, I return to the airport, over an hour before the flight even closed (all flights close for check in 30 mins before take off) only to find myself and my son running down the terminal towards the gate, with the 1 bag that I paid to have checked, but there was no time to check it in.

So everyone waited patiently for about 2 hrs, then all of a sudden here comes that loud voice again and it said we don't have the part to fix it. There's no need to worry, But of course We are the ones that have been waiting for 3-4 hrs. Then they say a plane will be flying in from Florida to fix the plane in Ohio and it will be 2hrs till the plane arrives before they even attempt to fix the plane I will be riding.

One can always go back and ask for tea/coffee. There is water/juices kept in the aisle but they really don't come back to see if replenishments are needed. In-flight entertainment inadequate for such a long flight. Flight path either not switched on in time or grossly inaccurate. Safety vests hanging out from below most seats.

No cabin entertainment (IFE) but I don´t mind it as the flight was only 7 hours. This was the main advantage of this flight but I think next time I will prefer a more decent company like KLM or Air France even if I have to make stops. The most terrible experience was our check-in from MAD to MUC. We stayed one night in MAD and had a flight from to MUC at 7:20 am. We already had our boarding passes and we only had to check the baggage in. We were at the airport at 6am. There was a big line as all the passengers for all Air Europa flights have to stay in the same line which later splits to many check-in counters. I asked the employee in front of the line if there is a special urgent counter for our departure and she laconically sent me to the big queue. So we waited and arrived to the counter at 6:30. The employee at the counter told us that check-in of this flight is alread closed! She got a bit stressed and tried to call some colleague without success. Finally, she told us: ""Take your baggage and run to catch your flight!""   It meant we had to throw away our liquids, two bottels of rum from Puerto Rico and my pocket knife because there was already no way how to get it to the plane!

The incoming aircraft for my connection ORD-DTW came in a hour late, and by then we were caught in the storm and flights were grounded. We boarded the aircraft twice, and were told to deplane. Eventually the flight was cancelled. A 3:50pm flight to get me from ORD to DTW, I was still in ORD at 930pm. I can't get my checked bag as there is no procedure for that, and it will be on the next flight out to my final destination.

As it was only 4 hours by bus from Chicago to Detroit, I decided to take mega-bus rather than to fly, and thank goodness I did that, because the rebooked flight on the next day was again cancelled due to air control issues! My bag actually arrived at Detroit earlier than I did, and I had to make a trip to the Detroit airport to get it.

So there is a recurring theme here, this airline requires you to pay attention, read the contract of carriage and abide by a little different set of rules. After readign the contract for carriage I realized buying travel insurance is a good idea with these guys because they can and will cancel a flight and only refund your money.

After take off, the flight attendant was walking with bottle of water and few plastic cups offering water. That was the only service available. No coffee, and when requested by one passenger the reply was that it was only for Business class passengers. After handing out water the flight attendant was nowhere to be seen until start of descent. Considering that the ticket for this return flight was more than 400 €, this service was terrible. They are not a low cost airline. In comparison, return flight operated by Austrian served coffee, bag of cookies as well as a small bottle of water.",Economy,4

At the airport in Pointe à Pitre we flew to Fort de France with Air Antilles - from Pointe à Pitre we did not have the chance to print the Air France boarding tickets from a ticket machine as it is only possible from the departure airport, meaning from Fort de France. So once landing in Fort de France we got our flight ticket from the ground staff but they forgot our bus ticket as we had to change from airport once arrived in Paris. We asked it to the staff at the boarding who nicely gave it to us. Onboard we seated in the middle row in the middle seats - unfortunately not so comfortable, not much places for the legs and going out was quite an adventure (bags on the way and headphone wires annoying). I was freezing on flight as I was seatting in draft, even the blanket did not help! Fortunately the staff on board was very nice and helpful.  No unpleasant surprise. ",Economy,5

My main dinner was ok but why  do we always get served a seeded brown roll? Where were the gluten free crackers to go with the cheese? And why do we always get a hard green apple? My family all had 'normal' food - lucky them, crackers for cheese and cheesecake dessert. I know there are Gluten free crackers around and I also know there are individual pot desserts. Breakfast was a yoghurt a fruit drink and a muffin, why couldn't I have a white bread roll with jam and butter and the muffin and juice?

This flight was excellent as it was only half full and I had a whole row of 4 seats to myself. The seats in economy are arranged 3-4-3 and quite comfortable, there was no one behind so I could recline my seat. ICE entertainment was very good but not the latest version as on the A380. The food was OK and they were generous with the drinks making several runs with the trollies during the flight and picking up litter. Unfortunately this is not always the case with Emirates, I've been on full flights with bad crew who are stingy with the drinks, slow with the food then leave your tray for 2 hours so you can't leave your seat, all deliberate tactics because they can't be bothered to deal with a full flight, over 300 people.",Economy,8

Premium Class also comes with priority check in, priority security line, priority boarding and first off bags at the destination airport. I fly all over the world frequently, and have flown on many airlines and have to say that the flight I took on Thomas Cook today was probably one of the best flights I have taken. From Check in to baggage claim, staff were extremely polite and friendly. The plane was a brand new A330. The seats were very comfortable with good recline. The plane was clean. The entertainment system was easy to use, had a good selection of movies, TV shows and music and it had a USB charging port. I never usually eat the meal when I fly, but I did on this occasion as the food was excellent. The drinks selection was also impressive with lots of premium name brands. ",Premium Economy,10

IFE is top of the industry and is the best. Not only do they have a plethora of TV series but they have entire seasons. My biggest gripe about Emirates is the inconsistent service. Some of the flight attendants are wonderful but most of them on this flight were rude and unfriendly. Service was extremely slow and call bells were ignored. They had very terrible attitudes which is appalling. For example, during the breakfast service, a croissant was thrown at my tray because the flight attendant was simply too lazy to lean over a bit. Trays were also left in our tables for over two hours and when I tried to go to the galley and personally put it in the cart, I was met with a shrugged look. Catering was a disappointment and options easily ran out and were unimaginative, not what it used to be. DXB is also a mess and would try at all cost to avoid.

The plane was new and the seats were comfortable and spacious enough, not the upper deck in ecconomy. However being seated next to the toilets was not the best location, particularly as we had pre booked the seats online. The service was excellent and the staff helpful and happy to be there.

A small but tasty snack and full bar service was available on the short flight to Toronto and the FA was friendly and very efficient. Flight from Toronto to Beijing had an orderly boarding process and was ready for departure however a last minute delay was encountered to remove luggage belonging to a passenger who did not show up. The aircraft interior looked in dire need of an overhaul with floor boards torn off at the pods, food splattered on the pod walls and side panels of the seat hanging loose. The service from the FA's was warm and conducted efficiently. Food was of reasonable quality and quantity and it was good to see an updated menu. There was a good selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks but there were no hot beverages available during the 13 hour flight due to a maintenance problem. I learned later in the flight that the very same aircraft had been suffering from this for the last three weeks. IFE was disappointing as the content had not been updated for the last four months and did not match what was advertised on their website and magazines. The pod style seats need an upgrade as they are worn out and becoming uncomfortable. The flight arrived late but mainly due to congestion in Beijing. Luggage was delivered promptly. Overall it was an OK experience but lack of coffee and tea on a very long flight (especially to China) was inexcusable.",Business,5

Food was sufficient but there was no prior cocktail service. Nothing was offered. After asking, the FA was cordial and served us the drinks of choice. Service was professional and exceptionally quick.

Despite the many negative reviews about Air China economy class, the fare was too good to travel with another airline. Overall, the experience wasn't too bad. We booked via an online travel agent, so were unable to select our seats online, but it wasn't a problem to contact the Air China customer service team and have our seat selections noted. The seat pitch was the same as most other economy class flights, although the foot rest on each seat was made for smaller people so it restricted leg room when raised. The crew didn't speak much English, but they knew enough to get by, and the in flight announcements were understandable. The inflight entertainment selection didn't have a lot of English language options, and was very limited overall when compared with airlines like Emirates. The food wasn't great, and the only wine available was a choice of red or white Great Wall Chinese wine, neither of which were nice. Overall, I'd fly Air China again if I wanted to travel to or via Beijing, but probably not again otherwise. ",Economy,6

My partner was on a special diet and his meal was put in front of him 90 minutes before mine. 4 hours later he still had the tray in front of him. When the food does arrive it's sub standard with yet another annoying snack box containing hard breads and a sweet sticky chilli sauce.

I fail to see why we should pay the same price as row 1 passengers (we were row 2), when we have nowhere near the amount of legroom as row 1. Service was very average and I believe if you choose and pay for exit row seats with a premier airline in economy, it may be cheaper and more pleasant.

With my Star Alliance Gold status, I was able to use the business check-in counter, which took less than 1 minute, efficient and pleasant process. They didn't bother to weigh my carry-on like some airlines. I was allowed 1 suitcase (10 kg) plus a small backpack or laptop case. There was no automatic check-in kiosks. Star Alliance Gold passengers can access the lounge for free-a nice feature. The flight departs on time. The A321 is in excellent shape, clean and well-kept, including IFE with dozens of programs at every seat even on short domestic flights. Nice leather seats. Seat pitch is reasonable. Flight attendants look sharp and professional. On this short domestic flight, refreshment is coffee or juices. I paid about $80 for a one-way one hour flight with a 7-day advance purchase.

If you pay for a meal, it is atrocious even by airline standards. Basic things like check in from the city of origin to destination if you need a transfer in SIN are not included - there is a fee (marketed as Scoot-Thru) if you do not want to go through customs. I took two trips with them (one “Business” – read premium economy) and one economy, and have had surprises on both. The latest was not being able to check in online from Hong Kong. Atrociously inconvenient and indicative of shoddy service. Definitely an airline to be avoided.",Economy,1

Only about 10 seats were empty in Economy and Business Class was almost full. There was an on-time departure and an early landing in Bucharest. The flight was carried out by a relatively new and clean A318 which is still being kept in excellent condition! The flight cost 69 Euros (one-way), which is acceptable. There was a breakfast served, consisting of 2 croissants and 1 fresh danish pastry, along with some drinks of choice, including coffee, tea etc, even on a 35 minute flight! There was no IFE, but it wasn't needed, since it was such a short flight. Most of the flight attendants were relatively kind, showing quite some significant improvement, which is impressive. I have flown on Tarom very often recently and will continue to do so.",Economy,9
931,air-canada,T Eldem,2015-07-29,"Slow check-in in Beijing. Used the Air China Business Lounge which is consistently disappointing. Flight was ready to leave the gate on time but ATC had grounded all flights due to pending thunderstorms. The captain did a stellar job keeping the passengers informed while we waited on the tarmac for 4 hours. The crew served water, juice and snacks during this time. Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep. IFE content was mediocre and sound quality was poor. Due to the lengthy delay in Beijing, I missed my connection but the wonderfully polite and helpful agent who took my call at AC's Concierge Desk had me secured on the very last flight out and even had my boarding pass delivered to the arrival gate in Toronto. It is nice to see there are still some service-minded people left at AC. The flight from Toronto to Montreal had very basic service given the short duration and the time of day. Luggage delivery both in Toronto and Montreal was shockingly slow.",Business,5

My previous trip with China Eastern Airlines a year ago was delayed 4-8 hours both directions, but I'd thought they would do better this time round. Both credit cards on ceair.com was repeatedly rejected and had to call the service hotline to make a booking. Airline hotline took the booking, but declined to take down my FF (told me to look for my partner airline, basically it is not their responsibility). Check-in directions were confusing at PVG (went to the wrong international flight counter) and check-in staff wasn't that helpful. Plane was new, but service left much to be desired. Blankets ran out halfway through the cabin and I was basically told ""sorry but you are on your own!"". The toilet was in a messy state (I will leave it at that). Passenger next to me decided upon himself to take up all 3 seats next to me and left his feet exposed while sleeping - the stench was unbearable and I had to tell the passenger off. The hard product means little if it is not backed by its service. There was good variety for food but it would have been unfamiliar for anyone outside of China.

While the aircraft appeared a little tired, I was impressed with the business class cabin service, catering was good for the series of short flights undertaken and seemed on a par with short-haul Qantas 737-800 international service. If requesting a seat during the booking process, I recommend selecting 1 D E or F. While there are three seats on this side of the aircraft rarely is the middle seat used. These seats are exit row and can, depending on the aircraft configuration, have up to almost a metre of legroom. All Business seats behind row 1 appear only to have legroom akin to economy class (which begs the question why pay so much extra for no more legroom). I fly business class regularly and would happily fly Comair again when next in Africa, and BA when travelling in Europe.",Business,7

Other than the cheap, highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. Staff service minimal - they served breakfast and collected the leftovers, basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight - not even an additional beverage service. I'm sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. Return a couple of days later, older aircraft but clean. Same indifferent service, similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink. This wasn't a cheap ticket (over 200GBP) - I know BA are competing with low cost airlines in Europe but when are they going to realise they aren't a low cost airline? A bit of chat from the staff and a couple of extra coffees would have made all difference to how I felt leaving those flights. BA sadly seem to be falling behind the crowd.",Economy,4

During the inbound flight I was served a 4 course menu, with 2 choices for the main course, with excellent wines, return flight was in the morning, so breakfast with 2 choices of eggs (scrambled and omelette), fresh fruit platter, greek yoghourt and bread. Responsible for the Business class section was every time the Maitre de cabine, who was very attentive and kind. Flights were on time (ish) and transfer in Athens was easy and smooth, even though inbound luggage could not be through-checked because of the lack of customs in Mykonos Airport (it was on return though). Only slight downside was check-in at Mykonos at 6 am, with only 2 counters open and queue moving very slowly, taking me 20 minutes to check-in my suitcase.

On the first case I was booked business class, but when I got to check-in, Etihad did not have me on the flight list on a full flight, despite SAA being able to provide the codes. I had to wait until 40 minutes before departure to know whether I would be able to fly and then it was in economy class. I was promised follow up - the flight controller even confirmed my email address - I am still waiting. The second time, today, flight EY471 from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was delayed by three hours. I fly a lot, and I know these things happen. The proof is in how the airline treats you when they do. I am carrying a letter saying that hotels are booked if the new connection required more than eight hours waiting time. Mine requires fifteen. As I could not access a hotel (transit hotel full and I need a visa for any others) I was given food vouchers and told to wait in the terminal. I had to argue for lounge access (this time I am flying economy, but it seemed logical as lounge access Appears to me a notch down from the promised hotel accommodation). I was told it is full. Eventually the desk took pity on me and granted me five hours in the lounge. When I got to the lounge, lo and behold, it was empty. And just now Etihad refused to renew my voucher - from the mouth of an uninterested and unapologetic desk officer. I was also sent to and fro from the SAA desk to Etihad to sort out boarding passes. I have flown SAA for many years, and with many of its Star Alliance partners. I have two thoughts coming out of these experiences, one that I would not choose Etihad or an Etihad code share flight ever again if I can avoid it: even if the in-flight experience is good enough.

Only after reminding the ground crew that Luanda is an not an easy destination to reach, that we had confirmed tickets and that we hold Star Alliance did we get on board. The flight from Brussels to Luanda was just not good. The cabin looks and feels fresh and clean, food is acceptable but there end the positive comments. The seats are nothing but horrible. In theory they may be ok but that's only on paper. You feel cramped with little legroom and the backrest has a hard area that sticks out and makes it difficult to lean properly back. The recline is ok but as long as you have someone behind you, reclining is not an option. The fact that my traytable was very loose of course did not help.

When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777.

Both flights on-time with good food and competent crews. The only bugbear is you'd think with a crew to guest ratio of 3-1 that it wouldn't kill the crew to do a few water runs inflight.  The return flight had Etihad crew supervising so maybe the Alitalia crew will no longer (famously) spend the entire flight behind the galley curtain.,Economy,10
970,air-france,Michael Elmer,2015-07-22,"Business class, what a joke! Economy seats just leaving the middle seat vacant does not make it business class. The only good thing I can find to say is that it was on time and safe. Food was better left alone.",Business,2
971,japan-airlines,Nancy Kun,2015-07-25,"The Good: very polite and accommodating ground and flight crew. Food was decent and plentiful. Both flights departed exactly on time. The de-planing process upon landing was very quick. The Bad: Exceedingly uncomfortable seats. They are lumpy and hard which, for a long haul (12 hour) flight, was terrible. In Tokyo, I was absolutely dreading my return flight home on these seats. To mitigate the discomfort, I purchased an inflatable ""donut ring"" cushion and sat on that on the flight home. If you take JAL, please consider bringing an inflatable cushion along. The USB charger outlets that are so prominently advertised as a great feature of the Dreamliner do not work. On both flights, I tried the outlets at my seat and my husbands and asked several fellow passengers if j could try theirs. I tried at least 7 or 8 outlets on both flights. They do not work. Make sure your devices are charged. It's a long flight. Don't plan on being able to recharge in flight.",Economy,5
972,lufthansa,Tan Eng Hui ,2015-07-16,"My family took a long haul flight with Lufthansa to Berlin via Frankfurt. They only give us a transit time of 1 hour 5 mins. By the time we came down from the plane at Frankfurt, I happened to look up at a clock in the airport, and it was already 20 minutes into the transit time. We walked to the gate, and it was a long walk. An airport staff member stopped the whole group of passengers from going down to the immigration clearing area, which we had to pass through before we can reach our gate for the connecting flight to Berlin. He just said the area downstairs was too crowded, so we cannot go down. He held us up for 10-15 mins. Finally, we were allowed to go down, and there were only 6 staff doing the immigration clearance (as compared to over ten in Heathrow airport). That takes another 10 minutes or so. In the end, we reached our gate 2 mins late, and the plane had left without us. After that, customer service was non-existent. This is no fault of ours. They could not put us onto the next few flights as they were all full. We were told to go to the gate to wait and enquire if any passengers didn't show up. We tried this for one flight, and I refused to do it again. The next available flight was 5 hours later. But we would have reached Berlin too late for us to take another connecting flight to London. I have booked this BA flight some 4 hours plus after our supposed arrival time in Berlin. Yet we had to miss it. To add to the insult, we were told we had to take the flight to Berlin, or they would re-calculate the total cost. In the end, we had to pay out to get a connecting flight to London from Lufthansa.",Economy,1

We got delayed an hour because the engine on the airplane won't start, according to the pilot the engine was to hot and they had to turn off the entire airplane electricity, which left us without AC on the plane and the summer heat of Kuwait. They could at least let us go back to the boarding gate, until the engine gets fixed. Luckily the engine started and we were on our way to Abu Dhabi. We were served a chicken sandwich and water. That's it. No, salad, fruit or dessert. Nothing, but a mayo-filled chicken sandwich and water. Very disappointed with this airline, first and last time flying Etihad",Economy,4

977,air-canada-rouge,Shirley Leong,2015-07-08,"If you investigate Rouge in advance, and consider this to be Air Canada's vacation tier product, I think you will be fine with the level of service and comfort. I have seen complaints about the premium economy seats on these flights - these are definitely not to be compared to business class. They are larger but still economy style seats (no lie flat, no pods etc.) I have status with Air Canada (which did not do much for me on this flight except for a faster luggage drop off.) I was flying with 2 other couples and a 1 year child, for whom a seat was purchased. Seat comfort: I upgraded to a seat with more legroom (Rouge Plus - not Premium Economy, just a seat with more legroom in economy). There was sufficient legroom for the flight - better than the Air Canada Boeing 777 with 3-4-3 seating which I will not take again unless forced to. I would not fly to Europe in a Rouge regular economy seat as these are very tight. A pillow and blanket were supplied as part of the seating without extra charge. I was comfortable enough to sleep. Meals: Dinner (Chicken, quinoa salad, one roll, some kind of dessert) or pasta (did not select) is included on the flight to Lisbon outbound from Toronto as well as a slice of banana bread about 1 hour before arrival. Two or three drink services (two on the overnight flight and three during the day). Meals are included on transatlantic flights - you must pay for alcohol and only credit cards are acceptable. Quality was comparable to Air Canada Economy class,  which is to say, barely acceptable, but edible and hot. Meal on return was chicken or pasta - quality of meal was better. Snack provided was a hot chicken or vegetarian wrap. Edible. (Flew Rouge from Toronto to Las Vegas and on these flights you have to pay for food). Flight crew: Young, but very helpful especially with the baby and the car seat. Checked twice to see that the seat was approved (which is important to everyone). Service was decent. Communication: Our outbound flight was delayed 3 hours due to someone deploying an emergency chute while the plane was on the ground. Communication wasn't great but I did find out the reason by speaking nicely to a person on the desk. Announcements were made twice that we had a $10 credit to spend in the terminal on food. Not a lot, but at least we only had to show our boarding pass to get the credit, so did not have to line up for a voucher. Inflight entertainment: Runs on iPad (your own or one you can rent for $10) or some Android devices. Had no problems with Android on this trip (did have on a previous trip, so they may have fixed this). One plane had universal plug/usb outlets for charging, but one did not, so I wouldn't count on this. A reasonable selection of movies for a 7 hour flight. We all arrived safely, our luggage arrived as well, there was enough on board storage for carry on luggage now that Air Canada is enforcing the size restrictions on carry on luggage (something I approve of) and it all was relatively uneventful. Overall I would fly Rouge again but only in a Rouge Plus seat. It is convenient not to have to transfer in say Frankfurt to get to less travelled destinations in Europe like Lisbon. I like the non stop flights that are offered by Rouge. You need to understand however that this is not the top tier product and you are paying for a lesser product but not having to stop anywhere.",Economy,7
978,oman-air,C Leigh,2015-07-19,"This was the first time since 2013 I'd used Oman Air and I would echo what some other reviews have said in that their onboard quality has begun to deteriorate and is showing signs of budget cuts. As always though the ground staff are excellent in London and Bangkok, check in staff are always friendly, welcoming and good to have a small conversation with. I used their online check in which is vastly improved since 2013 but at check in whilst chatting to staff I was moved to exit row seats due to my height which was very nice of them. On board the seat layout is still welcome as the extra space compared to competitors is felt after a few hours in the air. Even the exit row seats feel spacious in width with the wider fixed armrests. The little extras like menus, hot towels, and amenity kits no longer exist. Not major losses but noticeable. Meal portion sizes seem reduced too but the food quality and taste still seems better than competitors. On board staff are polite and professional, not quite as cheery or conversational as some other airlines but certainly everything you need on board. Muscat airport is starting to feel the weight of increased passenger numbers, I still like this old quiet airport but it felt very full this time and the transfer via bus to and from the terminal building is tiresome. There were problems with processing all the boarding passes for my flight and everyone was issued a new one with a new seat which made for an hour long queue to enter the boarding gate and a bit of a hectic mess on board with people wanting to move. For the price during summer and winter I think Oman Air is very hard to beat on this route. I look forward to using them again next year once the new muscat airport opens.",Economy,8

There was a huge selection of free movies and music to watch and listen to during my flight. I also happened to leave my handbag on the plane on my way to Milan and I was sure that I wouldn't get it back, but as I was checking in my luggage, a flight attendant approached me with my handbag, asking if it was mine. I was pleasantly surprised. My comment is that on my flights to Milan and back, the wifi and internet did not work at all, but the movies, games, and music on the TV screens worked perfectly, so this didn't impact my experience that much.

The crew in First Class were not trained and qualifed for First. Staff did their best and were friendly but service was more J than F. Due to late departure, they had a problem with catering, many items for the dinner were missing. The food we had was superb, however too many things were missing.

Cabin was clean, and flight attendants welcomed passengers in a friendly way. The new seat is superb: private, comfortable and lies almost flat allowing for a reasonable sleep. Entertainment system also had a great selection of movies, games, and TV shows. Food selections were good quality, although portions were a bit small. Flight attendants were able to suggest wine and were quite generous about serving it. Once service concluded, a self service bar was set up in front. One thing I liked about Iberia is that flight attendants are not intrusive, which can be confused with uninterested. This is probably a cultural misunderstanding, because while other carriers have an almost prying and intrusive service, in Spain, it is considered respectful to let people reach out if they need something.

Under an hour before we were supposed to board, we were told that there was about an hour and a half delay. Not too bad yet. However, as time passed, the delay got pushed further and further, until finally, our new departure time was 1.00 am. This was a complete nightmare for all passengers, including those who had very young children. Instead of telling us right away that our plane would be delayed until such a late time, they kept us at the airport, waiting, with very little information as to why the delay happened. ""Compensation"" was $20 meal vouchers that were useless at the time, since most of the restaurants in our area were shut down for the night. We also got $75 vouchers for excursions, but it still did not make up for a day of our vacation ruined. Two weeks later, on our way back to Toronto from Holguin, our plane was in a similar situation. First a four hour delay. No explanation. The delay once again got pushed to later times, until it was over five hours of waiting in our hotel lobby without air conditioning.

A crew member helped cleaning the table, yet leaving me with sticky pants and sticky floor carpet under the seat in front of me. Flight EY 6299 - operated by South African Airways, flight SA 279. Service on board, excellent once again by South African Airways. Very friendly and considered staff! On arrival in Johannesburg, about 150 passengers found out that the luggage never arrived in Johannesburg. The queue for baggage claim was very long, yet well handled by South African Airways staff. The entire debacle cost us 2.5 hours! We were told an aircraft would arrive at 16h00 local time with some luggage. At 18h00 hours nothing heard of course. If luggage would not be there with this mentioned flight, it would be the following day. No need to say I have lost all confidence with Etihad.",Economy,3

We were flying with GA 404 on July 22 2015. The ground crew were not able to give us the further information. Fortunately we were able to take off after waiting 7 hours at Lombok airport.

1009,air-canada,Deborah Taylor,2015-07-04,"Upon arrival at the airport, we paid $75 for 3 pieces of checked luggage and went to the bag drop only to be told we didn't have seats as the flight was full. If someone has paid for a seat on a plane, they should have that seat. After a few minutes of arguing, he assured us that we would be on the flight. When we had gone through security, we went to the customer service desk and explained what had happened. The lady there told us we did not have seats at this stage and that the guy in baggage drop had no authority to guarantee that we would get on the plane. She told us to wait at the gate to see if we were allocated a seat. After a very tense hour, and after most of the passengers had boarded, we were eventually called to the gate and given boarding passes, seated several rows apart. Compared to other airlines around the world, and particularly our domestic flights on Qantas and Virgin Australia, the standard of service is well below par. Having to pay for checked in luggage on top of an inflated flight price, and only offered a soft drink or juice and small pack of nuts adds insult to injury. They made the end to our lovely 6 week holiday in Canada a stressful time unnecessarily.",Economy,1

Both times transferring in Abu Dhabi. Not impressed with either the airline or Abu Dhabi Airport. Our transfer time outbound was 1.5hrs. Very long taxiway, then bus to the terminal. After passing through security ""last call"" was being announced for our flight to Phuket. And we still had to run from T1 to T3. Somewhat better on the return trip, with just over 3 hours transfer time. At the time of booking our flights we were informed that it would be A330s all the way. But 3 of the 4 flights were changed to Boeing 777's, one of them without informing us. Seating on the aeroplanes was not good - cramped, not much leg room. Cabin crew were not at all friendly, in fact, rather surly. Food was far from good, in fact inedible. The only thing we can't complain about - no delays - all flights either on time or early. However, on arrival back in Manchester 1 suitcase did not arrive. At least 4 or 5 other passengers from the same flight experienced the same thing. In fact one told us that he had flown with Etihad 3 times in the last 2 weeks - each time at least 1 bag was delayed. I can update progress, having just rung Etihad, the lost bag arrived on this morning's flight. Will hopefully arrive by courier later today.

When we finally realized it, the plane was pulling away from the gate.  No announcement or email message (but they can bombard me with ads on my email account).

Our meals ok but nothing special. Movie selection was a little disappointing compared to previous Emirates flights. I struggled to find something decent to watch.

The long haul offered two meals. Dinner was edible but breakfast was better. Drinks are free flow and crew are happy to serve water. IFE is channel-based (you don't get to choose the show on demand, rather what is being shown), and it may not interest those who don't know Chinese well. Did not hear the Captain speak for this long stretch, and crew's English announcements can be hard to hear. Flights to and from TPE: Breakfast appeared to be simpler. Captain did give announcement for this stretch. Wifi IFE is available for flights to and from TPE, but Air China specifically bars mobile phones from accessing this system. If you don't have a laptop, you are probably out of luck. Premium economy seats are empty, and are basically the same economy seats on SYD-PEK (channel-based IFE).

I took a round trip flight from NY to Paris in July 2015, and it was one of the worst experiences I have had. The airplanes I took were old model, they did not have TV's, they had monitors. Because the planes were so old, the seats were extremely uncomfortable. There is no option to push your seat back because there was no space! Even if you had that option, it would be almost cruel to the person sitting behind you. I am 5’1 and my knees were almost touching the seat in the front. So if you are taller than 5’3, the economy ticket of this airline is not for you. I had to stand up a few times during the flight in order to have some blood circulation though my legs. Also, if you are a person who likes air conditioning, their planes are room temperature. Meaning, for me, it was hot throughout the whole flight. The food was decent, but the flight attendants were rude. You are only allowed to get water or coffee with your meal, for everything else, you have to pay extra. $4 for a can of coke! Overall, it was a nightmare for me, mostly because I was so uncomfortable, spending 8 hours in a hot small space was not pretty.

I would also think that after having people waiting such a long period of time that they would offer something other than a beverage on the plane, they didn't even seem to have coffee for the travelers when the flight finally left. A very disappointing and stressful travel day.",Economy,1
1053,lan-colombia,Patricio Dangelo,2015-07-28,"I flew twice from Bogota to Miami on LAN, on June 28th and on July 26th. Plane old 767 but in good condition, very good entertainment system and very comfortable economy seat. Paid US$50 to sit in the economy first row but definately worth it, it had tons of legroom. However there are 2 negative points of LAN: first, the meal. They serve a cold disgusting sandwich on a route where the 2 other full service airlines (Avianca and American Airlines) serve 2 choices of hot meals. Two thumbs way down. But the worst part is having to deal with their reservations department. If you buy a ticket on LAN, make sure you do not change it. It took me 3 calls to have my flight changed, the first 2 tries I was given wrong information by 2 totally clueless agents in their call center in Colombia. Finally on the third attempt an agent in the call center in Chile could change my flight. Each time I was on the phone with them about one hour. ",Economy,4

1055,qatar-airways,R Clarke,2015-06-16,"MEL-DOH-BAH. The journey back to Bahrain from Melbourne was an awful experience. Flight QR905, June 6th was delayed 45 mins. Ground staff at the gate were not sure what was going on and it seemed organized chaos as a lot of passengers were complaining quite profusely. There was no specific lane for business class passengers to board,
something that was quite obvious on my trip through Hamad Airport going to Melbourne on QA904 on the 21st May. Problems start on QA905, once in the air on a 14 hr flight you want to relax and have creature comforts. It involves the inflight entertainment system. I started watching a movie once we had taken off after the 45min
delay. A passengers IFE was not working so the chief steward was trying to help fix it but sadly he did not inform others that he was going to shut down the IFE for a reboot. My screen suddenly went off as it did for a number of other passengers. This rebooting was tried 3 times then the chief steward just said we can’t fix the problem. This is unacceptable in my book, no portable DVD players were available like you have on Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines and Silk Air as a back up. The system is very fragile indeed and many headphones were not working or only working in one ear. I had to change out 2 headphones to get to hear proper sounds. The next flight 7th June, Doha - Bahrain on QR1121 was just as bad. 55 minutes delay and gate C-28 was just utter chaos. Appalling organization by Qatar ground staff at this gate who again were not that customer friendly. The special lane for business class passengers was not even open and we were lumped in with everyone else. The next time I travel to Melbourne I shall not be using Qatar.",Business,1

Cabin crew were friendly and helpful and always happy to answer questions. Food was really good, a lot better than other economy flights I have taken. Coming back I upgraded to Business Class and was given seat 7a.

They already had a counter set up next to our check in desk and insisted we pay £11 or remove something. I had to open up the bag and pull another pair of trousers and a tshirt on!

I was quickly placed on stand-by for another flight to Chicago, but soon realized I would not be able to get on that flight, as others were trying to fly stand-by as well. I had to take my original flight, which was delayed three hours, due to the fact that the aircraft was coming from Dallas and was delayed due to storms. I missed my original flight to Appleton, so was booked on a later one. In all, I spent about 15 hours on planes and in airports.

When I pay for a business seat I expect that seat section will be free and I won't be charged for another $147. The b-class is not uncomfortable, just configured weirdly, with little storage space near the seat. The FAs have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window, which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them. The food was flat out lousy-it looked like bad microwave fare. The service was OK, nothing special. Although I wasn't going to watch any in-flight entertainment, I did check it out.

Missed Club World check-in. Next day very efficient priority security straight to lounge. Very crowded but found seats eventually. Ordered champagne delivered promptly but it was difficult to get a refill as staff a bit overwhelmed so fixed own G&t. Boarding on B777 efficient and shown to 2 back facing seats, basically a double bed. Glass of champagne provided as we settled in. Take off a little strange as traveling backwards but when in cruise no problem at all. Several drinks services before and during meal service. Very relaxed and very professional crew. Food mackerel pate and steak quite good but not business class in its heyday which I was privileged to enjoy. The seat was strange. Very narrow and a lot of the time you are looking into a strangers face. BA has 8 across seating, more than any other business class operating the B777 in the World. Entertainment ok. Reasonable screen but hardly World Class. Things going fine until, 3 hours from touchdown they said that champagne was finished as they had to save enough for returning passengers. What about we passengers who had paid a lot of their own money to fly Club as a special treat. We persuaded a very nice first Class CA to raid first Class to provide a glass of champagne. After that we were on our own with the Club Kitchen. What a joke. Packets of crisps and a choice of red or white.  Very poor indeed for business Class.

We have waited on hold for hours trying to connect on the phone to a customer service agent only to be disconnected when their automated system tried to connect us to a representative. This happened multiple times. So if a Greyhound bus with wings with no service in the air on on the ground works for you, then Allegiant is your airline.

A few people asked them to take it off the plane as it was unaccompanied luggage. The crew indicated that they were told it was OK. We again protested so eventually it was taken off as it should have been to start with. To top it off they were serving paid for drinks and snacks and were so slow that they only got half way down the plane (1.5 hour flight) and they had to stop as they were landing.

On my flight to Sao Paulo the A340 is still in good condition, staff helpful and polite and the food very tasteful.

Compared with some other airlines the Swiss Business Class screen of 12 inch doesn't compare to what is on the market. If you choose to watch films with a dark background most of the detail in the film escapes the eye. It is almost difficult to watch and for long flights a good screen is important. I hope that with the new Boeing 777's coming in 2016 they will decide on a new system for video/audio.

1081,united-airlines,K Rakow,2015-06-19,"Domestic First Class/International Business Class, ORD-EWR-MXP. Purposely booked a 2 hour connection at EWR given United's timeliness issues as of late. United changed the flights shortening the connection to 1hr 20. Called and had changed to a 3:25 hour connection. Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago. Arrived over 3 hours late in EWR with departure to MXP showing on time. After a sprint to the connecting gate, the MXP departure pushed back multiple times and we finally boarded about an hour an a half late. Typical ‘old United’ flat bed which I like better than the Continental flat bed as it seems to have more leg room. Pillows and blankets have been upgraded. Ordered my meal on a tray in one go so I could sleep and all but dessert was delivered when everyone else was getting their first course. Food was decent, much better than old United. IFE is sparse with less content than a few years ago but I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own and the power at the seat kept everything charged. Cabin staff basically disappeared once the meal was served – no one coming through or replenishing water. They appeared about 1:30 before landing for the breakfast service. We arrived about an hour late but the bags were delivered in a fairly timely manner and all of the bags arrived. My return was cancelled and I ended up on Lufthansa all of the way back. Much better, especially seat comfort and reliability, except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly, I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion, United has become very undependable, both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint, since the merger. Much of the US hub counter staff is now outsourced and they are of little help when something goes wrong. The hard product and service is average to slightly below average. Economy Plus on UA is still great value but I am starting to avoid United when flying on an expensive ticket or an itinerary requiring connections.",Business,3

1095,spirit-airlines,J Kapo,2015-06-16,"Some of the reviews about Spirit baffle me: Much of the criticism seems to center on Spirit charging for everything other than getting you to your destination. I don't know if these people have been living under a rock or what, but everything Spirit charges extra for is clearly explained on their website. I have flown Spirit twice
now, once from CLE to DFW, and once from CLE to LAS. Three of the four flights were on time, the fourth was delayed by about an hour. The Airbus A320 fleet - the only plane Spirit flies - is one of the newest in the industry. The interior was as clean as any other U.S. airline, though I admit that's a pretty low bar. For the most part, the crew was professional. At this price point, all you really can expect is a seat on a jet to get you from point A to point B. That's all, nothing more. And Spirit generally delivered on that promise. This is not to suggest that flying Spirit is for everyone: The seats are very thin, and if the person behind you decides to move his or her table tray around, it feels like someone is thrusting their knuckle - two knuckles - into your back. There is no curbside check-in. And because Spirit has no reciprocity with other airlines, if your flight is cancelled or suffers a long delay, you are stuck until Spirit can get you there, which may be 24 hours or more. But fortunately, I experienced none of these problems. If you read their website and can live with Spirit's scaled-down way of doing business, you stand a good chance of traveling for significantly cheaper than on any other U.S. airline.",Economy,9

We had to get out of line to print boarding passes on the machines (which we didn't know because leaving Cleveland the machines were broken) - during the time we got out of line and input all the info needed on the computer a ticket printed saying see the front desk. We wait in line again get up to the desk and the attendant says we don't have enough time to make the flight. She wasted so much time giving us the run around then said we didn't have enough time to make it to the gate.  If she would have just printed our ticket we could have made it.

My husband likes a beer or two and I like a nice gin and tonic or vodka and tonic. On a 10hr flight we were offered one drink with our meal. I was told there were no spirits on board and that beer was limited. After the initial drinks service (nearly an hour after take off) and the mediocre meal service (no choice of meal), we were not offered any other drinks. I found a member of the crew in one of the galleys much later and managed to het a beer for my husband and some water for myself. The return journey was as bad if not worse.

The problem is this seat configuration is used throughout Europe and it's possible to be in such cramped conditions for a longer flight. Upgrading to business isn't a solution as there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have flown both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few weeks as well. Both had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but not Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive, polite and helpful.

1101,virgin-atlantic-airways,Phil Tucker,2015-06-16,"What a mixed bag. I had been so keen to fly on the Dreamliner and actually tweaked our plans to go out and back from LA on this plane. Due to money constraints, this is our first economy flight as a family. Many years ago I flew with Virgin on business to Vegas in economy and vowed never again. The flight out was fine. It is a really good aircraft. Seems generally, really spacious. Plenty of room in the overhead lockers. We fluked bulkhead seats going out and these were good with decent leg room. The seat is a new design and very slim. Quite hard though for 11 hours. Due to not having a table on the seat in front the table folded out from the armrest along with the TV. This meant the seats were really, really narrow. I am a normal sized bloke and this seat was narrower than on any two or three hour hop in Europe with budget airlines. There was a small amount of recline and this did help comfort a little. The food was as you expect it to be. Edible calories. The service was reasonable although very noticeabley different than in premium cabins. Very rushed. The flight home was terrible. I had paid for extra legroom seats and found myself next to the toilets getting stood on and kicked pretty much all night. Virgin should not under any circumstances sell these seats as some kind of benefit. If anything they should give them to people they don't want to fly with them again. The plane itself had lovely big windows which helped the general atmosphere and we did really feel a bit better due to the improved air / humidity etc. Due to the cabin being a 3+3+3 the aisles were really tight. Passing through the PE cabin I was also quite surprised at how cramped the seats looked. All in all, I would not be keen to do this again. If this is the future of flying then I am afraid that we shall be flying less long haul. We are going to Australia next year and there is no way in the world that I will be flying Virgin for this. I think it is time to change my allegiances and to try other airlines for long haul.",Economy,5

Drinks and bottled water, not tap, was offered every now and then. Although there is no screen in front of you to provide you with in-flight entertainment or location, they have an app that you can download on your Apple or Android where you can access some good movies from.

We found these tickets at about eighty dollars cheaper than those for American, and decided that saving was enough to get us to try this airline. I wish I had paid the extra money! What really got me angry enough to write a review, which I may have done twice in my life, is the fact that not only do they make you pay for luggage, but they make you do it each way! There's also the seating. We had one stop from Denver to the Dominican Republic, which meant we would ride a total of 4 aircrafts for the round trip. That means you have to pay for seating 4 times. Or risk it like the lady at the counter told us. She went on and on about how booked the flight was, and about how their system assigned random seating unless we pay for it, and about how she could do nothing if our two year old son got separated from us on the flight and that the only way to guarantee that wouldn't happen was to pay for it.

The same goes for WiFi which they claimed was available, but did not work even on a flight within the mainland US. As for entertainment, I am sure that you could have a great selection, but they charge you for watching everything and anything, including TV programmes. Inflight staff were rude beyond belief. Aside from behaving as though they were doing you a favour by even noticing that you were on the flight, several of the staff would openly talk about and complain about passengers within hearing distance of the passengers themselves.

I could not believe we were boarded when there were no pilots in the plane.  Since the plane had
obviously not been cleaned upon arrival from the previous flight we were instructed to leave the plane with all of our personal belongings and wait in the tunnel that leads from the terminal to the plane for a security inspection.  After the cleaning was done we were instructed to board again to wait for a pilot to arrive. When the
pilots did arrive they decided the plane needed refuelling so again we should wait a while for that to happen. The flight finally took off at around 8.00 at night.

The service is as good as any Middle Eastern airline and the connections to places like Vietnam from New York are amazing. The trouble is that they ruin it all with the transfer desk in the Seoul airport. After a relaxing flight, you arrive in Seoul at 5 AM and are tossed into a seemingly endless maze of travellers who are forced to go through security all over again to transfer flights. There are no special lanes for business or first class. Poor families with babies are also tossed into the cauldron.

The SFO-HND route featured chicken sandwich as a snack and chicken porridge for breakfast. HND-SFO route featured a tuna melt as a snack (that sounds like a recipe for disaster, right?) and a corn soup / cream of broccoli mixture. I was expecting more, having flown ANA and United in the past. Note that you can look up the inflight meal on their website. For IFE there was a personal tv on the back of each seat, with a decent selection of movies and television programming, though not as much as on Delta flights that I have been on. I slept on the flight, so I didn't watch too much tv, but there were some recent movies from early 2015. Service was nothing special. FA was friendly, but failed to collect the plastic beverage cups and trash after the first beverage service.

Transfers were one of the easiest we've experienced especially on the return flights. London ground agents booked our seats not just to Seoul but Sydney as well, and our bags were automatically transferred by the airline to our Sydney plane as there was no layover. This gave us more time to relax in the lounge. Onboard experience was fantastic. Three out of the four legs had excellent flat beds and only the Sydney to Seoul leg had angled seats which were great for a day flight but I'd question its comfort overnight. What was truly memorable was the gracious and respectful cabin service on every single flight. The crew seemed like they weren't just great attendants but great people in general.

The New York to Rome flight meal service consisted of dessicated pasta and a couscous salad. No vegetables, no cheese, and a stale roll. We thought it was because of an American supplier that didn't understand that this would be an unacceptable meal for an Italian. We were wrong. On the return flight we had a two-pasta combination which was terrible, and a salad of rice. Before landing, we were served an anemic muffin with no butter or jelly.

However we were unhappy with business class Atlanta to London. It was either stiflingly hot or freezing cold. The seats were meant to lie flat and the advertising shows a woman lying on her side on the flattened seat. Interestingly she is a petite woman as anyone of average size would only be able to lie on their back when the seats are reclined as the legs are enclosed by the seat in front. My husband (who luckily likes to sleep on his back) and I swapped seats half way through as my seat was faulty and would not recline at all but I was still unable to sleep because of the seat configuration. I am a woman of average size. When my husband took it over he fiddled to see if he could get it a bit better and succeeded in releasing the leg rest which then became stuck so he spent the rest of the flight bolt upright with semi-raised legs even for landing! The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat, remotely, electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again. The food was very poor for business class (compared to BA for instance) and my husband's gluten free food was functional mainly consisting of fruit especially melon though his chicken main course was actually better than my standard meal. Breakfast consisted of granola (so sweet it was horrible) or eggs and he got a dry bread roll which was unheated (most gluten free bread is only palatable when heated) and a very poor quality gf sausage. There is such a huge range of gluten free foods now that it seems as if the airline's caterers are just not trying.

assignment unless you pay another 33 Euros for each service for each leg of the trip.

However, as of Friday July 24 2015, my family and I will no longer be flying Allegiant. We had an early flight out (6.45am), had checked in the night before, and arrived at 6.00am to depart as the airport is so small, it never takes more than 10 minutes to check in and get to gate. We couldn't find any signage indicating where to check bags through for Cincinnati and simply got in a line curbside because I had five days earlier experienced the same thing when dropping my son off to fly same route and had been directed there for checking his bag. We got in a fairly slow, long line and just as we reached the check-in attendant, after having been interrupted several times, she made the announcement baggage check in to Cincinnati, and several other cities was inside! We go back inside the Allegiant terminal, get in another line only to find out as we approached counter, we're told baggage check for Cincinnati was in Terminal A and pointed to a different area (one we never knew existed)! The attendant then tells us the flight just closed and we'd have to find another flight home and the fees would be $75 each person to do so. We explained we'd been there in lines trying to figure out where we were to check in and saw no indication Cincinnati was in Terminal A. To top it all off, the flight we were supposed to be on that closed at 6.10 had a thirty minute delayed departure. Had we known prior to arriving, we were to go to a different check in terminal, I would not be wasting my time sharing my negative review.

The English-language skills of the crew were not the same as those on the PVG-SYD sector, but one must remember that these were flights between China and Korea, and so it's entirely reasonable to expect that the crews will be best at communicating in Chinese and Korean.  Blankets, pillows and slippers were provided on the short sectors.  It's worth noting that the economy cabins were very full on the PVG-ICN-PVG flights, but business class was a ghost-town in both directions. Not so on the PVG-SYD sector, a ten-hour overnight sector on the A332 equipment designated as 33E, i.e. 6-abreast seating in business class, with 180-degree recline and a significantly larger entertainment screen, and two business-cabins separated by a galley.  There was only one empty seat of the 30 in the split cabin, the passengers were about half Chinese nationals and half Australian, with a couple of Europeans and a Canadian to boot. On boarding we were met by the Purser/Service manager, a young woman of Chinese heritage who spoke excellent English with a distinctively Australian accent. We were escorted to our seats and offered sparkling wine, orange juice (with pulp, not the overly-processed kind) or mineral water.  Soon after that, menus were presented.  The flight had a full dinner service, from which passengers could choose Chinese style with two choices of main course, or Western style, with two choices of main course.  Dinner was served course-by-course and there were no trolleys used for either drinks or food.  Table-cloths were used.  Breakfast choices were either Chinese or Western.  The wine-lists had a (real) Champagne, three reds and two whites, which in my opinion is entirely enough.  A decent selection of soft-drinks, waters and juices was also on offer.  Amenity kits (with Clarins products) were already at each seat. Dinner service began soon after takeoff, and soon after the closing of all the window-blinds (this was common to all the MU flights on this trip, and I found it both odd and a little irritating, however this is what the crew are trained to do!), after which pajamas and slippers were distributed. The seat reclined completely flat, the pajamas were soft cotton, and the duvet was soft and thick.  Interestingly, the cabin temperature was kept quite low on this flight, in contrast with other airlines from Asian countries who, in my experience, keep the cabin temperature warm enough to grow orchids in Iceland. I was woken hours later by the clinking of cutlery in the galley, and having returned from the spotless bathroom, was offered breakfast.  The dim sum were hot and tasty; everything on the tray was tasty.  Breakfast was offered as passengers woke, rather than throwing the lights on and insisting people wake-up because the trolley is coming.  Very civilised, and other airlines could learn a lot from this. We arrived in Sydney on time, and I must say that China Eastern was surprisingly good.  I didn't have sky-high expectations, but that was wrong. The English skills of the crew on the PVG-SYD sector ranged from very good to excellent, and the crew were attentive and very polite.  All in all, a positive experience on MU for a very very keen price.  I would gladly fly with them again in business class.",Business,8

Had to use stairs, then a 15 minute bus ride then a train ride into chaotic terminal 3 with no help at all to get to the gate. At least 20 on the arriving flight had to run for their lives to get to our gate on time. Was exhausted and not even a minute to have a drink in the lounge. The A380 great after the 777. At Heathrow waited an hour at the carousel for the luggage. No help from any Emirates staff only one bag out of three had been loaded in Dubai. They should have sent someone to the baggage reclaim to advise as there were quite a few people who had no baggage. When we got through immigration the Emirates car had left us stranded. On the return the Dubai leg was good but a repeat of the first leg the Cape Town flight parked miles away from terminal 3 and boarding was total chaos. Lugging your overnight bags up stairs I thought went out in the 60's. No amenity bags on the Heathrow - Dubai was told that if the flight is under 7 hours and in Daylight that's the new policy despite the fact you paid a premium for the ticket. I think Emirates has grown way too big to cope or care about their customers and they can't cope. Transfers between terminals in Dubai are a most unpleasant experience.",Business,7

1182,asiana-airlines,Hugh Sansom,2015-07-16,"The negative experience begins with the challenge of buying a ticket. Their website is difficult to navigate. Flight information is presented in a confusing manner. The best part is trying to reserve a seat. Knowing where you will sit prior to arriving at the departure airport is an important part of the travel experience. This is especially true when flying for 12 hours. Evidently, Asiana does not believe this is important and therefore will not allow 50% of ticketed passengers on their flights to reserve a seat. Instead, seat assignment takes place upon arrival at the airport. Asiana attempts to make up for the 'inconvenience' with a competent staff, but the inefficiency and uncertain seat assignment overwhelms their effort. Other carriers offer a significantly better experience.",Economy,1

The cabin crew were rude, unfriendly and very unapproachable especially when we needed water. There were passengers in the front seats who we assumed were airline employees. They were given priority treatment with much joking with the crew. All very unprofessional. At take-off and landing there was very little attempt to ensure seat-belts fastened or seats upright.

There was no decent food selection available, and the only things on display were packets of pot noodles and 3 cold salami sandwiches. So, as soon as it was announced the gate was open, we fled the lounge and went to the gate. After passing through security, we realised there was a 15-minute delay. Finally, boarding was announced, and, much to my dismay, there was no priority boarding! We finally boarded the flight and were taken to our seats by the cabin crew. Moments later, the purser appeared with a range of juices and hot towels. In terms of seat comfort, I found the seat to be comfortable, and after flying EK's, EY's and QR's Business Class, didn't find it to be all that bad. After a 10 minute delay, we took off, and the IFE was turned on while the crew prepared for snacks, consisting of sandwiches, chicken 'rolls', cake and tea/coffee. After snacks, we began our descent and landed in MXP, and the ground staff cleaned the plane while we remained seated. After everyone had boarded, we were given juices and cold towels again, and soon after, we took off, 10 minutes behind schedule. We were given our amenity kits, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. Dinner consisting of a steak, curry, rice, lentils and vegetables was served, along with dessert, which was cheesecake or a plateful of chocolate eclair and lights were turned off for passengers to go to sleep. I fell asleep and woke up with only 2 hours to ISB when lights were turned on for Breakfast. Breakfast consisted of a sandwich, a croissant, coffee/tea, a roll, cold chicken cuts and a shashlik. About 1 and a half hour after breakfast we landed, right on time. De-boarding was swift, and soon enough I was in ISB. It was a wonderful flight, and definitely worth the money!",Business,9

Cabin staff were efficient and friendly-meals were reasonable-in fact I quite liked them (I have eaten a lot worse). Entertainment system was okay-enough to keep us occupied on the long flights. Only issue we had was when one of our bags didn't arrive in Calgary-spoke to a staff member at the service desk and she assured us that it would be found.

It took LH staff over 30 minutes to resolve, but in the end, I am sitting comfortably onboard. Boarding was efficient and smooth, and my seat (exit row 28L) is perfect. We pushed back 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The cabin crew have been particularly attentive, efficient, and friendly. Beverage and meal service were quick. My only complaint is with the new economy drink and meal service. Although the inflight menu continues to list sparkling wine as available for purchase, the reality is that in economy, champagne is not to be had for love nor money. This is a discrepancy that should be resolved, either by changing the information in the inflight magazine, or preferably, by restoring this purchase option.

Our return flight actually left a few minutes early and arrived back home 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Again, the staff were very helpful and friendly. Sodas, juices, water, coffee/tea, and wine were served at no charge. Beer and mixed drinks were offered for an additional charge. Snacks were offered at an additional charge. They also served a hot bistro pastry at no charge that was only so-so but hey, this is airline food not a 4 star restaurant.

1191,british-airways,Heather Worthington,2015-06-29,"Our night flight was delayed by nearly an hour; not the fault of the airline but a contributory factor to our disappointment with BA on this flight (17th June 2015). We paid extra for our Premium Economy tickets, then extra again to reserve seats, and past experience with BA and with equivalent seats/service on Virgin Atlantic had led us to expect value for money and some small rewards for the extra costs. Not this flight, however, where the only real benefit appeared to be a small amount of extra legroom. We were last to board after First, Business and Economy. Where customers in Premium Economy used to be greeted with the choice of a glass of fizz or orange juice, now it is water or juice. Once we had taken off, drinks were served; fine, but when the steward came to collect the empty glass/bottle, he knocked the glass onto the floor, where it broke - the staff were all rushed and seemed to be short on numbers perhaps? I was made to feel that the breakage was my fault! Dinner did not arrive until after 11pm, by which time I had rather lost interest, as had my partner. So far, our extra costs had bought us extra leg room and one glass of wine (I was not offered a second, possibly because of my crime of causing the steward to break a glass). Overnight, by contrast to other night flights, the lights were never fully dimmed; there were no offers of water/orange juice to prevent dehydration. The promised (on the menu card) morning 'light snack' and coffee/tea/fruit juice was a hastily delivered piece of dried-up cake and a weak coffee - no mention of fruit juice. I couldn't really see what my extra costs were getting me that those in Economy had for less - the extra leg room was rather negated by the passenger in front's fully reclined seat. I will not, if at all possible, be travelling with BA again. It left a rather sour taste at the end of our holiday.",Premium Economy,3

It turned out it was Air Canada Rouge, flight AC 1902. The experience was mostly poor. The airplane was a 767-300 with tight legroom and no entertainment monitor displays. This was a big surprise for a transatlantic flight. When I did the web check-in on aircanada.com, it showed that the airplane had individual displays. The crew said you could download the application on an android or apple smartphone or rent an Ipad for $10. Of course we do not have such a device for each member of the family and paying for such a basic service item was out of the question. The Wifi was slow and the entertainment server would show busy many times when we tried to connect with the smartphone. The food was below average but the washrooms were kept in good condition during the flight. The only positive was the crew. They did all they could to help with questions and queries. I am not impressed with Air Canada Rouge. The quality of service is much lower than with Air Transat which we used to travel to Spain, Portugal, and France.",Economy,2

Beer and wine are once again complimentary (finally!), and the meal is doled out in three smaller ""courses"" instead of being dumped on your tiny tray table in one go. The food itself (cheese ravioli) wasn't bad at all, again much improved from my last trans-Pacific last year. It's a US airline, so you still have to deal with the occasional long-tenured yet disgruntled flight attendant, but overall I didn't hate the experience, which is saying a lot for a 12 hour flight in Economy on any airline.

We made the reservation through a travel agent at US, we chose this airline for its shorter travel time and slightly lower price. Our transfer time in Beijing was 1h 40min. When we book the ticket, the airline told our agent it is not any issue. This is a lie. On the way to China, flight attendants told us that we need to get our baggage in Beijing and then return them for the transfer (this is fine, and we do this when we get to US). When we arrived, the help desk woman near the baggage claim said the same thing. However, we waited and waited, but our luggage never came out. We asked the attendant who supervises the baggage claim, she said they will be directly sent to the final destination. Of course, we missed our connection flight. When we went to change our flight, the Air China staff said we do not need to pick up our baggage and tried to blame this on us. Later, I found out they should have paid our lodging since this was their fault. Of course, they forgot to mention this. On the way back to US, our flight from Hefei was delayed for 24 hours. Basically, Beijing Airport did not allow any flights to get in that day. So after notifying us the flight had no departure time, no one from Air China showed up to assist or answer any questions. We were kept waiting and waiting. After sitting in the airport for 8 hours, finally two low-rank Air China staff showed up and could not solve anything. When the passengers got upset and asked to see the supervisor, one of the staff said the manager does not work on weekends, instead she got four security guards! We and two fellow passengers had international flights at Beijing, and were stuck. We called the airline help desk, they said they are not responsible for anything and cannot make any changes since we bought our tickets from an agent. If we need to change, we need to go to Beijing. Essentially, if you are not at Beijing, you are screwed in any emergency situations. Once we got to Beijing 24 hours later, the staff at the counter were rude, unsympathetic, and unorganized. There were so many passengers who missed flights, and Air China had only 2 staff members to deal with the passengers. If you do not insist on them providing a solution, they just brush you aside. We had to stand before them for 2 hours before it can be finally resolved. Overall, if you could, do not take Air China, the service for emergencies such as delay, particular in any other cities, is non-existing.

During the flight the handle of the toilet flew off, one of the overhead bins was loose and the table holding the bassinette was broken. The carpet was threadbear and the equipment was being held together with tape. They did not have enough food, and nothing available for me (I have a nut allergy), the food that was served, was not fit for human consumption. The toilets were not cleaned during the whole flight (13 hours), and as a result the smell from there was disgusting. The rubbish bin was overflowing with waste, which included soiled nappies. The only time we saw the cabin crew was when they were serving food. They looked very scruffy, not what you would expect of a BA cabin crew. All in all a very unpleasant flight.

We flew Alaska Air there and returned on Air Canada flights. Big mistake! We booked last October and had confirmed reservations. From the moment we arrived at the airport, there were problems. First, their carry-on size is smaller than other airlines. OK. We repacked and paid for an extra checked bag. Then we proceeded to get our boarding passes only to find out we were on standby. No reasonable explanation offered. We proceeded to the gate where I stood ready to be first on line. The gate agent was patronizing and condescending, at best. He finally told me it was my fault since I did not select seats when I booked (the system said I could not select seats and would have to get them later.) I have travelled the world over for business - I am not a rookie at this. We waited and did get seats. Then they asked people to check their carry-on bags for free since the flight was full. We did it and were assured we were checked through to our final destination. Our first leg is completed - comfortable seats and good food options on board. Upon arrival in Toronto, we had to clear customs. We do all we are required to do, but we are not cleared to proceed because our bags have not been accounted for. We wait and are in fear of missing our next flight. Air Canada stamps our card so we can proceed. We run for the gate only to find the plane is not even there. We finally board and get to our final destination late. We wait for our bags and one is missing. No one from Air Canada is to be found and their phone system is very slow.

1228,united-airlines,Brian Fox,2015-07-22,"On Sunday, June 14th, my family and a close friend took a flight from Newark Airport which should have connected in Toronto to a flight to Dublin, Ireland. Unfortunately, because the Captain of the flight did not turn up for his passengers, the flight was delayed for approximately 3 hours. (United Airlines staff in Newark informed us that this was the reason why we were delayed.) This was not a weather-related incident. In any event, this delay caused us (and others, I believe) to miss the connection in Toronto. We were not rebooked to another flight. Instead I was told that all of United's flights that night and following day were ""oversold"". I asked if we could fly home and was told that that would take days as well. The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted, that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was 'not allowed'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution, but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel. If we had not fought for hours, late at night, we would have been left to sleep in the chairs of the airport with my 5 year old daughter. While I am grateful that we finally were able to get on another flight - to London, then Dublin through British Airways - we missed 2 days of our trip. Coming home we had another ordeal with United. The return flight which was changed to a departure in Dublin to Washington D.C. and then, on to LaGuardia was actually worse. While turbulence cannot be helped, one of the flight attendants hit her head. This meant that paramedics had to care for the attendant first, which delayed our flight and caused us to miss our flight home. I had to rent a car to get home.

Well, we had a gut feeling ""should"" wasn't enough so we went to another counter. They said we would have to change our flight because we would only have 4 minutes to make it to a gate on the other side of the airport before the flight departed. We wouldn't have eaten calmly and taken our time to do things if we were told that to begin with! So they tell me we will have to stay an extra 5 hours sitting at the airport to our connecting flight or that we would have to pay for a hotel and stay the night in Charlotte, they wouldn't pay, but regardless I had to be in Charleston that night. So I asked to be refunded because it was not sounding like great options. There was a sweet lady that helped us and told us to let the flight attendant know we had to make our earlier flight as soon as we landed. However when we got onto the plane about 2 hours later, they delayed us another 30 minutes because of traffic. We wanted to leave, I would make it driving down south faster than flying (and a lot cheaper), but a nice lady on the plane saw how upset we were and helped calm us down. She then explained that we wouldn't be able to make it to our earlier flight, but that we could ask the help desk to get us seats on the 10:30 flight, or have the airline pay for our hotel to leave the next morning because the delay was due to ""maintenance"" issues. We had no choice so she met us as we landed and tried to help us find an airport nearby our original location for a friend to pick us up at. Her shift was over and was beyond sweet for helping us for so long. She actually found us a flight leaving 15 minutes after we landed but they wouldn't have been able to deliver our luggage. So we took the seats on the 10:30 flight and of course without sitting together (I get anxious so I always need someone, so my fiancé and I were upset). We sat there and of course, they say they have to change a tire that would take a bother 30 minutes. That whole trip ended up totaling 11 hours after delays, maintenance, and layover.

I think I agree with the review by M Brown on the 20th March, people are being are rather unfair particularly with regards to the catering situation on Icelandair - they are very clear on what the product being offered here is and there is opportunity once booked to add food from the regular menu at a discount before flying and this is served to you before the main food service begins. I only pre-ordered food outbound on the long-haul KEF-PDX sector and found what was served to be delicious and good value. All non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary and can be requested at any time during the flight. All sectors were on B757, which whilst relatively old were immaculately maintained. Outbound from Gatwick the plane was a bit older and had no IFE, but this was ok for the short flight to Reykjavík and I was notified 24hrs prior to departure of this via text. On the long-haul sector from Keflavík to Portland the aircraft was more the Icelandair standard product and we were presented with bottle of Icelandic water which was a nice touch. There was IFE on this sector but it was very old, with poor quality picture and didn't have a fantastic selection - but I had brought my own entertainment with me anyway. The staff however on this flight were fantastic and really worked hard to be friendly and attentive to passengers needs so much so I will be writing to Icelandair to tell them so! Flying back to Reykjavík was pleasant with blankets and cushions provided for this overnight sector and IFE was newer and the the best of all the sectors with a clear picture. My return to London a few days later was also fine with everything on schedule and generally pleasant. One thing that didn't work on any sector was mobile boarding passes - this didn't work on a single sector for me, but I easily received a paper version in most cases.

We always get to the AF check-in counter at Dulles International and discover that despite having booked our seats together, despite having the same last name, despite paying for the tickets with the same credit card, and despite paying full price we are not seated together. And I had called 3 times to confirm that had reserved seats together. Our record was separated and we were seated apart. By good fortune, the woman who had the seat that I was supposed to have was right behind me at the airport. She had booked her ticket 5 months after I did, through a travel agent. Further conversation revealed that she had AF Flying Blue status, although she's a US citizen. It appears from our chat, that AF allows its own customers to reserve seats in business class up to a few hours before departure and thus bump passengers like me and my husband, paying passengers, at will. This leaves the check-in staff at Dulles to flounder for explantions as to why we are separated. In addition, when the check-in staff reassigns us, the computer system is never updated timely enough for the gate agent to recognise the new seats. Confusion at the gate. Embarrassment.",Business,1

On the new 10 abreast B777 with the narrow seats, armrests and aisles. My usual aisle seat was most uncomfortable.

Our flight Zagreb left on time, arrived Doha early and we left to Dubai just on time too! On our flight to Dubai the boarding was quick and easy. Flight was comfortable and food on board was yummy.

I only had a very brief visit to their lounge in Doha, but what I saw was very good, my only gripe was that they used buses to and from the planes on both flights in Doha. Qatar Airways London assured that airbridges would be used, especially as they now had a brand new airport, so it looks as if they haven't been informed about them still using buses or they don't want to tell you. As I am 82 years old I find it difficult walking up and down those stairs carrying two cases. Hopefully on my return flight in September, they will use airbridges , I'll have to wait and see.

1260,ukraine-international-airlines,S Scott,2015-06-17,"I frequently and gladly fly ""budget"" airlines both domestically and internationally - I know what I can expect and what not to so by no means was I under the illusion that I was going to get a luxury experience. I flew from Athens (5.30am) to Kiev (laid over 2 hours) then on to JFK (arriving 2pm same day) for a total of 13 hours of time in the air. Flight Athens to Kiev was fine, flight attendants were nice and courteous. I slept most of the time and they did a brief juice/coffee service just before landing. Once in Kiev, be prepared for perhaps the rudest airport experience. Airport staff (from food service to duty-free to security staff) were miserable. Kiev airport has limited food options, so be prepared to settle on a mediocre sandwich. Flight from Kiev to JFK was hands down the worst flight I have been on. The seats are horrible. I am 5'10 and my knees rubbed the seat in front of me, the seats are narrow and are as big as you would expect from a tiny regional aircraft or island-hopper, not what you would expect for a long-haul flight. The seats themselves are extremely uncomfortable and are terrible in causing lower back pain, and recline only an inch or two. The cabin crew took the cold, aloof, and rudeness of the Kiev airport staff to an entirely new level and were openly hostile towards passengers. The food was laughably bad, but the worst part is that they offered maybe 500ml of beverage for the entire 10 hour flight. They did 3 separate drink services and each time you get about 150ml of beverage in a tiny solo cup, the size many people keep in their bathrooms. I've never been happier to land and be done with a flight, and would not wish flying UIA for long-haul flights on my worse enemy. I would describe the in-flight experience as a 1/10 and the only reason I am giving 5 stars is because the entire flight from Athens to JFK cost me $330 which is insanely cheap and was approximately half the price of the next cheapest flight from another airline. So if you're trying to backpack/budget fly and need a really inexpensive flight into/out of Europe or Asia, take UIA but seriously prepare yourself for a horrible flight and I'd recommend bringing a liter of your own water.",Economy,5

Also on the first meal service we where informed there was no scotch as they had run out. First meal service. That is not good enough. The staff were polite, the meals OK but for an international carrier to have no headsets for a 9 hour flight is ridiculous, and concerning.

I measure 176 cm so the seats in full flat position were quite good, no worries there, the food was enough and good. The only down side was the inflight entertainment system. They have an ok selection in films but the screen size and resolution is not up to business class standards, some airlines have a better system even in Economy. I do hope that they improve with the new B777 entering next year. The 12 inch is not nearly good enough and the resolution is passable.

The problem is that we paid for an economy plus seat and still had to wait at the end to board. The flight crew was average but what upset me was that a poor woman with limited English asked the flight attendant for some water so she could take medication before take off. She was pointing at what she needed in the galley and the flight attendant screamed at her and threatened her with disembarkation. For a five hour Pacific crossing all we got was one drink service and food purchase which is unacceptable. After a four hour stopover we boarded again with the same procedure. Once we got on our way the flight attendants provided their usual sub standard service. However, as this was a single aisle aircraft some passengers needed to go the bathroom and with drink service going on the access to the bathroom was restricted. The flight attendants in first class made sure that the economy passengers stayed in their section.  All I can say is that flying domestically is more or less not worth it. Luckily, majority of my trip including two flights on Air New Zealand who treated their passengers with respect and were not afraid to offer complimentary food and drinks.

This summer we took 8 flights with Turkish Airlines – starting in LA and going to Istanbul, then traveling around the country also with Turkish Airlines, roundtrip to Denmark - and then back to LA. Quite a lot of time, money and interactions with the airline in June and July 2015. The initial trip was good, and we enjoyed the entertainment that helps make the 13 hours bearable. The food was not great. My request for vegetarian food was only honored on the trip to Istanbul. Lost luggage, rude interactions with Turkish Airlines staff at the check-in counter and onboard, zero accountability and initiative. Our luggage was lost 2 times during the 8 trips – first with a connecting flight from Istanbul to Izmir. The plane was delayed from Kayseri so it wasn’t a big surprise – despite the fact the agent at the gate ensured us it was on the plane when we boarded. After1.5 hours the luggage appeared. And we got to our destination at 1 am in the morning. The second time – on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul – one suitcase was lost, remained lost for about 2-3 hours with no explanation – and very little care from the staff at the lost and found office. After continued pressure they suddenly produced the suitcase, and we could get to our hotel. No explanation, no apology no care whatsoever. The following day we left for Los Angeles on our final trip back. We inquired, when checking in, if there was anything they could do to make our trip back a bit more comfortable due to the issues and time wasted earlier. In total we talked to six different staff members – first to a supervisor in the check in area – who said “no” and that was that. At the care Point – the staff couldn’t care less, the moment they were confronted with a problem, an unhappy customer, it appeared their command of the English language was lost, they gave us a blank stare and pointed to the gate. At the gate, we had the most unprofessional and rude encounter and staff said no. I was left with the impression that, no one cares, no one feels responsible and accountable, there’s an acute lack of training and proficiency in the most basic part of customer care. If Turkish Airlines wants to deliver on the brand promise – Europe’s Best Airline, they need to embrace a better approach to service – caring goes a long way when you are traveling, a smile, empathy and helpful interactions would have made a world of difference.",Economy,1

Service was perfunctory, which is what I am used from KLM. What was really annoying was a medical emergency, which led us to divert to Luxor. As a doctor, I offered my help, but it appears the decision had already been made, and we stopped in Luxor for about 4 hours to offload a passenger. This went on for 2 hours, then a further two hours wait to get permission to continue. At 1 am we were in Dar es Salaam, stuck in an unknown city in the middle of the night, with no assistance from KLM whatsoever.",Economy,5

On the return home, we missed our connecting flight in Charlotte because there was congestion on the runway. The next flight was not for three hours. Then that plane was late and needed repairs, so after seven hours in the airport, we finally got on a plane to fly the 45 minutes from Charlotte to Atlanta.

I was initially confused and frustrated by the online check in process - they assign seats upon arrival at the gate, and you can only reserve online if you wish to pay for 'More Space' seats in advance. Both the phone and Twitter operatives were helpful when I raised this with them. We arrived at the gate with about an hour to spare, gate staff could not have been more helpful. We asked to have two seats together and were told that this would be resolved once the staff had logged in. 15 minutes later, we were called to the desk and found that we had been assigned to More Legroom at no extra cost. We were delighted with this and the seats were very comfortable. We also loved the DirectTv and Sirius Radio live streaming to the aircraft, a unique touch. The unlimited soft drinks and snacks were appreciated. The flight staff were attentive and approachable. The captain coming out to make the pre-flight briefing personally was a great touch. There was an on-ground delay of an hour due to bad weather in Washington, but the captain kept us fully informed of everything that was going on and since they had the foresight to switch the entertainment on prior to take-off (why doesn't every airline do that), we barely noticed.

The 747 fuselage tapers at the back - there's not enough room for 3-4-3 seating, and rows 51 on have 2-4-2 configuration. Rows 49/50 don't have enough room for 3-4-3 seating either, but BA do it anyway by sneakily making the outer seats narrower than the rest. I endured a 9 hour night flight in one of these horrible seats, my back was twisted and sore for weeks after. This is just not acceptable for a long-haul flight, especially at night - BA charges extra for seats identified as having more room, by the same principle these seats should be advertised as having less room and cash-back offered for anyone prepared to accept them (small children, perhaps).",Economy,3

We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10A gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark.

Before booking, I didn't read any of the reviews, but did check out their website and requirements for luggage. Between my 4 year old and myself, two personal items was plenty of luggage, thus not being charged any extra. I printed my tickets at home. Also brought snacks from home and a couple of empty water bottles to fill up once getting through security. I was incredibly nervous after reading reviews. Arriving at the airport like they suggested(a few hours early), I headed to the checkin counter just to make sure I didn't have to do anything special for my personal bags. A Spirit Airlines employee was helping people at the kiosks and took the time to help me answer my questions in a very polite manner. In Boston that day, there were thunderstorms heading our way and rain had already started to fall, making me even more nervous than before. However, the flight took off on time. No one was given a hard time about their bags and during the flight, the attendents were friendly and even got my son to smile. The only negative about the departing flight was that we landed 30 minutes early and unfortunately, had to wait said 30 minutes for the gate to open. Still on time though. The return trip, I arrived at airport a couple hours early and went to the gate that was printed on my ticket and my flight wasn't scheduled to be there anymore. Went to the next gate over and the Spirit employee kindly pointed me in the right direction without any rudeness whatsoever. The attendents on this flight as well were extremely friendly, even funnier and one of the attendents even played cars with my son which was really cool. On my return trip, I did not bring any snacks, but for $6.50 was able to get wheat crackers, almonds, cheese spread, dried cranberries, oreo cookies and a mint. Not a bad deal at all. This flight departed and landed on time. I can't say what the economy seats are like as I purchased Big Seats. They were extremely comfortable and had more than enough leg room.

On the way back when trying to load this flight which was supposed to be done on a larger Boeing 767-300ER they anticipated the difficulty they would have with carry-on bags because there was significantly less room and dealt with it brilliantly. The check in folks in Toronto were terrible. Cranky and super unhelpful. We asked where to take our bags to check them and were dismissed with an ""over that way"". Well over that way was about a quarter mile down to the other end of the airport where there were no signs to guide us. We had to pay $25 for each checked bag which is ridiculous. If we had paid for a much more expensive seat we could have taken up to 2 bags free. Seriously you can't even take one suitcase for free because we're flying economy? There was no meal on the flight unless your were in Premium Rouge. We could purchase food onboard which was okay. There was a decent selection and the prices were reasonable. But again, seriously, not even a free snack on a 4 hour + flight? The planes had no in-flight entertainment except for streaming video to their app. This was okay but selection was terrible. All outdated movies and tv shows and not good classics.  I'm not sure what our fare paid for. We weren't paying for a comfortable seat, for space for our baggage, food or entertainment. It seems like we paid to be uncomfortable, annoyed and bored. Why is it that basic things like having enough leg room so your legs are smashed into the seat in front of you or having a snack on a long trip is only for luxury passengers?

1343,british-airways,W Blades,2015-07-10,"BA staff were excellent from the start to the finish. Service onboard was friendly, professional, and helpful. My wife left her handbag on board the plane when we arrived at Heathrow, and the BA flight attendant personally travelled from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5 to hand deliver it back to her. If you know the huge distance between terminal 3 and 5 at Heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. That exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these days, so BA get a 100% customer care rating from my wife and I. Snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. Aircraft was clean, however the only negative was the Business Class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that BA should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey. They were standard Economy Class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front.

The seats slide forward and recline only midway, so it's difficult to remain in position without sliding. I felt a lot of pressure on my legs just to keep me on my seat. On this particular flight, the seats were configured 2-2-2, but I've flown this route before where the seats were configured 2-3-2 (worse). No privacy. The seats are not wide enough and are so close together that I could feel my neighbour's every move. You also have to share elbow space with your neighbour. When there are drinks on the elbow area, you have to stay upright so as not to hit two glasses on that same space. Since there is no storage, your neighbour's meal menu, magazine or iPad will also be in your space. This is awful for a 3-hour flight, unacceptable for business class, more fit for premium economy. The toilets are also cramped. This is really light years away from CX long haul business class. They use planes with business class cabins configured for long haul flights on the Hong Kong-Haneda route or the shorter Hong Kong-Manila route, surely they can do the same for the Hong Kong-Narita route.",Business,6

Very smooth flight, we were told that the flexible wings smooth out almost all but the worst turbulence. What excuse will the crew now use to get a break? Food was a choice of Shepherds Pie, Curry or vegetarian. The Shepherds Pie was tasty but was tiny, a very thin layer of minced lamb covered by a very thin layer of potato. The blackberry sponge had sunk at one side and was cold and clammy. Seats were the biggest problem. Yes they are wider than economy and have 38"" pitch, but the one in front still reclines into your face and if that person reclines fully then your entertainment screen does not hinge enough to allow you to watch it without you also reclining your seat. Some airlines now have seats were your seat base slides forward so you recline within you own space. They even supply small packets of mints giving you tips on how to ""surreptitiously"" recline your seat without making it too obvious.

1356,turkish-airlines,Jagoda Risteska,2015-07-17,"I am a wheelchair user and traveled alone this time. Turkish Airlines staff made a problem why I travel alone, remarking ""I am not supposed to travel alone"", ask me to sign a document which says they are not responsible for any damage or injury if I would enter the plane. No other passenger was asked to sign this document. Also, after disconnecting the joystick of my power wheelchair, they did not allowed me to take the joystick with me, but put it in a plastic bag and wanted to leave it like that in the cargo part. After I disagreed, because it can be easily damaged, Turkish Airlines staff said to me that the company would rather pay for the joystick than something to happen to the plane because of the joystick. The joystick itself, when disconnected from the batteries has no any power, our laptops and phones can make more problem than disconnected joystick. I have been traveling with Turkish Airlines for couple of times and what always happens is that I am informed as a wheelchair user that I am not able to use the toilet during the flight, because Turkish Airlines does not have cabin chair during the flight, nor they would assist to push the chair to the toilet (which is service other companies offer). The longest flight with Turkish Airlines, in which I was not able to use the toilet was flying from Istanbul to Cape Town, with two hours stop in Johannesburg, so for 15 hours I was not able to use toilet. For passengers without disability, Turkish Airlines may be a good choice, because of their good connections all around the world, but for me as a wheelchair user is a headache. Because of the legislation, when Turkish Airlines is flying in USA, they do have different policy for people with disabilities because in USA you can not discriminate someone because of disability.

The main reason was price as they had a genuine buy one get one free companion sale and it was only £925 each when it was over £1800 from London. Check in was good but they share the British Airways Lounge, I've seen a lot of 1 out of 10's for British Airways on this site so enough said. The first leg was on the Qatar Airways 787 Dreamliner, the seat arrangement is 1-2-1 with only 5 rows so quite exclusive. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat bed style, fully remote controlled, with a big TV, desk, pull-out table, pillow etc and a nice welcome pack of eye cover, ear plugs, lip balm and some nice Armani products. The staff are excellent as to be expected from Qatar Airways but the menu and drinks options were not too impressive. However my wife enjoyed the pink champagne and I enjoyed their signature lime and mint juice pre-flight drinks. The inflight drinks options were limited unless you like wine, lots of wine choice. They don't carry enough of each meal so my wife and I did not get our first choice as we were sat in the back row of 5 they'd ran out! The second leg was on their brand new A380 with business class on the top deck. The seats and arrangement is the same as the 787 just more rows. The icing on the cake and by far the best selling point is the bar. The hostess on bar duty was lovely and made everyone welcome. There was a good choice of drinks and bar snacks, especially the individual carrot cakes. You get a fast pass before landing to avoid the hour long queue at passport control but no free chauffeur service, come on Qatar. Your bags get priority so they're on the carousel before you get there. Overall a good first impression although I was on their newest aircraft, can't wait to fly the new A350.",Business,8

This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case, once again, we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets. I imagine it is easy to overlook the seat pockets as fast as they have to turn the plane around but I still think an extra minute or two and it could easily be taken care of.",First,9

Addis Ababa airport was chaotic. A lot of people sitting around in corridors with mountains of hand luggage. The Ethiopian lounge was busy but I was able to get a seat. The seats looked good but were distinctly uncomfortable. No facilities for lying down or sleeping. Food and beverages were OK but not great. No showers and toilets not great. Wifi was available but very patchy in coverage and speed - staff were obviously aware of this as they warned me when I asked for the password. I was looking forward to the flight ADD-LHR as it was on one of Ethiopian's fairly new 787s. Boarding was fine. Business class layout was 2-2-2 but as there were few passengers, I could have an empty seats beside me. The seats were very disappointing and appeared to be an old design. They reclined to a relatively flat bed but it was angled and lumpy - not good for sleeping. Why Ethiopian would buy modern aircraft and fit them with inferior seats in their most profitable cabin is impossible to understand. Food was not good. I had beef which was tough and poorly seasoned. Other parts of the meal were similarly disappointing. In the business class cabin, there were 3 crew. One was dressed in a colourful uniform and was both pleasant and efficient. The other two were in drab outfits and had personalities to match. IFE worked OK but had a limited selection. The flight arrived on time. On arrival at LHR, my checked bag was not there. When I had checked it in at NBO, a large green tag reading ""transfer at ADD"" had been attached to it but, as I later found out, it had been left at Addis Ababa.

I asked a flight attendant if they at least had some kind of spray to alleviate the stench and she grudgingly produced something and stuck her hand around the door and squirted.

There was a complimentary Beverage service and a la carte snacks, However I found $4 US for a small pack of Pringles and $7US for a Tiny Bottle of Heineken a little steep. Seeing as this was a Domestic flight, I would understand the lack of IFE. There weren't any onboard power outlets on any aircraft. My Laptop died halfway through my flight to Philly.

1373,united-airlines,C Shearon,2015-06-20,"As a loyal United Airlines customer, with Global Service status for years, that following experience has helped me realize United neither values my business nor cares about my experience with their company. On May 29th my direct flight from Dulles to Kuwait was diverted to Istanbul. The pilots timed out and passengers were stranded for over 12 hours in Istanbul- with no Turkish visas nor United staff to re-book and assist with hotels (United has no service in Istanbul, agents were eventually flown in from the Middle East). Indeed diversions are neither planned nor pleasant; however, passengers anticipated United would have had a contingency protocol in place for such events. After being left to fend for ourselves, and spending hours on the phone (international roaming) with customer care, passengers finally reached Kuwait the following day to ultimately learn that the remainder our respective original itinerary were canceled meaning onward travel and return flights to the US had to be re-booked. Shockingly, United did not apologize for the inconvenience and (as of today- eg. 23 days later) has not offered to reimburse visa-on-arrival fees in Turkey nor the international roaming fees passengers encountered while trying on the phone with United’s “Customer Care” team. Furthermore, all passengers paid for the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, boarded the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, and apparently since United diverted to Istanbul, zero miles for the Dulles to Kuwait leg will be applied to passengers’ account as credit toward their annual status - seems unfair if United accepted the payment for the flight and we all boarded the flight. After over a dozen conversations with “Customer Care” leading all the way up to the Senior Manager for Global Services, I am deeply disappointed to say the agreed upon follow-up that was supposed to occur 5 days ago has not. The Senior Manager did have one of his subordinates send an e-mail stating they will be in contact as soon as they reach a conclusion to my request.

After several hours we were given a £5 voucher for food which at Gatwick purchases very little beyond a coffee and a bar of chocolate. When the flight eventually left the journey itself was fine. On the other hand the cabin crew were pleasant enough on the rare occasions that we saw them on the flight but spent 90% of the journey 'hiding' behind the curtain at the front of the plane, actively discouraging people from using the toilet. The customary trolley service was advertised in the customary seat pocket literature. 1 hour 15 minutes into what transpired to be a 1 hr 45 minute flight the service commenced. One reluctant member of the cabin crew somewhat hurriedly scurried along the plane avoiding eye contact and thwarting any attempt to eat by announcing when asked that they basically had no food, no ice etc etc. ",Economy,2

I do hope that the careless and somehow rude attitude of the cabin crew on the flight out of Athens was because of a very light load. Bucharest Otopeni airport is not a very friendly airport to connect thru, passport control was quick but the security check took some time since most of the domestic flights were scheduled to depart at about the same time and only one filter was opened. Crew on the flight out of Bucharest were much better though they could smile a bit more. They do offer cold sandwiches and there is the possibility of having beer, no IFE, seats on the Boeing 737 were ok with decent legroom but the ones on the Airbus318 were uncomfortable and less legroom.

1381,american-airlines,Matthew Butler,2015-06-17,"Throughout my recent trip, there were difficulties due to under-staffing at the terminals and ticket check-in, leading to several long delays. Several of us missed our first flight out of Gainesville since there was miscommunication leading to no one being at the check-out counter prior to our departure and none of the boarding pass kiosks working. The return flights were equally difficult, with only 1 kiosk working and only one person working the ticket counter, which lead to check-in requiring about an hour. Several of the initial flights were delayed, leading to several of us missing our connection. While this is understandable and does occur at times, it took approximately 2 hours to receive our hotel vouchers even though the flight arrangements were made prior. This was again due to being under-staffed as only 1 person was working this terminal. The following day, multiple flights were cancelled due to ""mechanical difficulties"" leading several of us to again miss our flights. This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled, causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight. I was initially told I would again have to stay over-night and was not given further options. After calling customer service myself, I found a flight to an airport 2.5 hours away although I was required to pay the rental car fee to drive back home. In summary, due to consistent under-staffing, there were numerous long waits which ultimately delayed travel planned. This combined with several flight delays (due to mechanical difficulties - not weather), lead do my initial flight leaving a day late and my return flight being delayed 2 additional days. I travel fairly regularly, and have never ran across this issue previously. I will avoid using American Airlines in the future if possible.",Economy,1

But after one hour we boarded the A321 for Tel Aviv. The plane is a basic Lufthansa plane for short haul, so there are no special Business class seats, only the middle seat is free, which gives you no more legroom. The crew was nice and served a pre-drink, as the flight was about 20 minutes late, due to high traffic in the air. Soon after take-off they served a nice Gin and Tonic with nuts.

One in Dallas and one in London. In the end it was 3. Our plane to Heathrow was late and we missed our transfer, so when we got off our plane at Heathrow an American employee gave us new transfer tickets and told us to hurry to our next gate to catch it. So we ran to the next gate which took 30 minutes (Heathrow). When we got there my wife looked at the tickets and the layover was 4 hours. So why did the employee have us run? Because the flight was to Florence, not Pisa and they probably didn't want us to notice. So we went back through security (1.5 hours, Heathrow) and we got new tickets through American through British Airways to Pisa. We had about an hour wait after another run through security (1.5 hours) and back to the proper gate. So why didn't American put us on this flight in the first place? They work with British Airways to get customers to Pisa! Since we got back I contacted American about this issue, they sent us a voucher for $200 for a luggage mess up on the way home.

1397,southwest-airlines,Carol Joseloff,2015-07-08,"Traveled with spouse, daughter-in-law, and 18 month old grandchild. Purchased tickets for the adults in February, paying extra for early boarding. Daughter-in-law decided she wanted to purchase a ticket for her child and have her sit in an airline approved car seat on plane, instead of on her lap. Agent told her not to bother paying the early boarding fee when she purchased her child's ticket as the child would be boarding with her mother. My daughter-in-law traveled this way with her child several times on Southwest without a problem. However, at Fort Lauderdale, when she attempted to board the aircraft with her child, the agent told her that even though her ticket listed her boarding group as A23, her baby's ticket said boarding group C and she would have to wait for that group to be called! During the heated discussion that followed, several passengers behind us boarded the aircraft. Finally she was permitted on the aircraft. My husband went to sit in the seat across the aisle from us and was told that seat was taken. Another passenger claimed he was saving several seats (I believe it was 6) for his family. The flight attendant was standing just one row away and was aware of this behavior. My husband ended up sitting behind us. A woman who sat in the window seat near him plopped her bags on the seat and said to leave them there as she did not want to have anyone sit in the middle seat. It appears to me that Southwest needs to revise its seating procedure! If you have paid an extra fee for priority boarding you are entitled to board according to the status printed on your ticket. If your family members( who are not young children) have not paid for priority boarding, you should not be able to block passengers from claiming a seat for which they have paid an extra priority boarding fee. If you are unhappy if someone wants to claim a middle seat, too bad! You should be forced to sit there instead. The same goes for all the baggage folks drag on the plane. Half of the passengers look like they are fleeing a war ravaged land carrying on huge bags or multiple bags. If the airline would support their seating and baggage policies all passengers would be much less aggravated.",Economy,8

1415,norwegian,Elizabeth Brealey,2015-07-31,"Stockholm Arlanda - LAX, flight DY7087, 30 July 2015: Our flight home to LAX, was chartered out to EuroAtlantic Airways. We were supposed to fly home on a Boeing 787, but instead were flown on a very old Boeing 777. This was by far my worst experience with a long-haul flight, and I travel internationally about once every 1-2 years. I will not fly Norwegian for a long-haul flight again in the future. I guess you get what you pay for. Problems during pre-flight check-in process: My seat was reassigned from 13D to 53A. I had paid extra in order to choose my seat when I booked, and so this reassignment to the back of the plane was not something I was happy about. At least my husband and I were reassigned to seats next to each other, which was not the case for some passengers. The pre-boarding process was chaos. All passengers were required to stay in a small holding area for more than 1.5 hours while waiting for announcements from staff. Boarding took about 45 minutes to begin. There was then no further boarding announcements, just a sudden chaotic surge of people toward the gate. No order of boarding by rows or early boarding was done. So the boarding process itself took at least another hour. By this time our flight takeoff was delayed 2.5 hours. Features of this aircraft which were very disappointing: Aircraft was dirty and smelt. Dust and food particles on seats, trash stuck in various places, including in the ashtrays in the armrests. The entertainment system was basically non-functional. After messing around with it we discovered it had about 4 analog stations showing 3 TV comedy programs in a continuous loop. Often there was so much static they were impossible to watch. The audio outlets appeared to be for the old 3-prong type earphones from the 1980s. Using my own headset only allowed sound in one ear. The gluten free menu I had ordered was delivered promptly. The flight attendants would not collect my trash for about 2.5 hours after it was served, even when I requested it to be collected. No climate control (air vents) for passengers. It was all centrally controlled, so either was too hot or too cold the whole flight. With my window seat, the window shades (closed) were very hot as we flew over Greenland and Canada. This made the flight even more uncomfortable. Very limited beverage choices, and provided infrequently. We had to go to the galley at the rear of the plane twice to request water. Positives about this flight: The seats had footrests, which helped a bit with my lower back pain. Relatively smooth flight once we finally took off. ",Economy,1

Qantas web site wouldn't do online check-in since first leg with Emirates so had to do it on Emirates web site, which wouldn't let me alter DXB-MEL seats. Aircraft new and well kept with comfortable seating. Boarding was fine and departure on-time. Although seats quite close together for such a long flight the leg room was good due to IFE being kept out of the way. Meals were pretty good and staff came around offering snacks and drinks regularly. IFE excellent - I found a good range of films and my kids were kept happy for the whole flight as well. They did most things well, but a few little things let them down: - Not enough immigration forms for all passengers. (Honestly, they know the number of pax on a flight, it can't be that hard) - When I asked for an amenities kit about 1.5 hrs before landing, they told me they had run out. - Flight path maps weren't working so it was hard to tell where we were.

Flights were all on time or within a few minutes of it, aircraft were spotlessly clean and even though the seat pitch is average for LCC at 29"", the seats are reasonably comfortable thanks to an intelligent slimline design - others could learn from this. Staff were friendly and professional throughout. In-flight food is purchase-only and expensive by Indian standards (although they will provide free drinking water) - a word of caution about pre-ordering, if you take up the 250Rs pre-paid option you could end up losing money, depending on your choice of food/drink. Also it appears they load up food and drink at the start of the day, and some options (e.g. Jaljeera juice) seem to consistently run out.

It is important to understand that Spaniards talk loud and do not like to beat around the bush, therefore, it sometimes appears like they might be angry or aggressive, while deep down they are more than willing to help! Boarding was carried out in a very organized way. Standing at the door, were a couple of flight attendants welcoming passengers politely. Other members of the crew were helping passengers find their seats and stow their bags. Once airborne, kids received entertainment kits, and passengers got earphones if needed. IFE had a wide range of choices from movies to games and IB information, WiFi and GSM were available, but I did not try it. Meals consisted on pasta or beef, but flight attendants came around a couple of times in case anyone cared for more bread. Coffee or tea was offered. I asked the flight attendant if I could have another glass of water, he mentioned he was busy, but that once he was done, he would bring it to me. I did not wait for more than 2 minutes, he came back with an unexpected glass of water for me in the middle of his tasks! Another flight attendant was equally enthusiastic and happy to help.

When I check the cabins inside, I saw spaces available. The crew/staff didn't even check to see if there was space which proves how unprofessional this airline is. I paid for my ticket and only brought this bag.

I understand that a lot of people go to Ibiza to party but so do a lot travel for family holidays - it was like a party plane. There was no control of the travellers who congregated in the aisles, sat 4 to a row (3 seats) sat on arm rests, music played loudly in the row in front of us (and not good music at that). The trolley of drinks and snacks was pointless on both the flight there and back as after a few rows there was nothing left (we were in row 14) the seatbelt light was put on half way through our flight out there when there was no turbulence - I believe this was to try and seat people but when my husband attempted to take my 5 year old daughter to the toilet (whilst others were still stood I have to add) a member of staff was slightly rude and told us she couldn't go and had to sit down.

The service on the flight out of Manchester was first class, the crew were pleasant and attentive. The food on board was plentiful and tasty and nice touches like the ice lolly and cloth to freshen up were appreciated. Lots of movies to choose from made the long flights much more bearable and entertaining. The leg room was adequate even for 4 of our party who range from 6ft 2 to 6ft 5, if no one reclines the seat in front, however if this happens it becomes a very uncomfortable long flight, which unfortunately happened to my son who is 6ft 4 but these are the chances you take if not paying for extra leg space.

Checked online flight departures from Gatwick South on the day before flight - no Small Planet flight listed. Got travel agent to check flights and they confirmed as advised on 26/05. Checked in okay but boarding pass wouldn't allow us through the automatic gate, pass had to be checked manually. On board aircraft 10.50 for 11.05 flight but ""Baggage duplication"" - all luggage being checked, then unloaded and passengers advised they would leave plane by front steps, identify their baggage and return to seat via back steps. Before this happened someone recounted the baggage and we actually had the right number! Took off 13.03, so almost 2 hours late. Flight okay, blankets and sweets distributed. One week into holiday and advised that our return flight time had been changed 2 hours plus later than the revised time. Had to change car hire/car parking times for the second time. Checked in early at Skiathos, when flight called was stopped at departure gate as seat duplicated, put to one side whilst other passengers boarded. Ended up with 16 passengers with duplicated seats, all allocated at check in a few hours previous! Odd seats then allocated to us and we were the last to board. Me in row 12 (extra legroom row), wife in row 2. Adjacent seat to me available but my wife wasn't allowed to move until the flight had commenced as it would ""Unbalance the aircraft for takeoff"", later allowed to move.

On original times we were due to land at 18.25 so 4 1/4 hours later than originally anticipated and with a 3 to 4 hour drive home, not ideal.

My elderly parents were booked on a flight from Izmir to Houston via Istanbul and were to meet me in Istanbul for the Istanbul to Houston leg. The airline only gave 45 minutes between the Izmir flight and Istanbul-Houston flight. I assumed this meant that there would be no extra passport checks (since that was all done in Izmir) and that there would be gate attendants to direct the passengers trying to make the connection to the proper gate to expedite the process. That was not the case. The plane from Izmir was stood on the tarmac for 25 minutes so they had far less than 45 minutes to get to the Istanbul to Houston flight, which was already boarding at the time and there was no guidance at all. When I inquired as to whether the flight from Izmir had arrived at the Istanbul-Houston gate and when I explained the situation, the staff ignored me and told me to step out of the way. They told me my parents had 5 minutes to get there and that if they didn't the plane would leave without them. They also stated that there was nothing they would do. They would not announce their names and began to laugh at me and speak about me in Turkish in a mocking way. In short, not only were they were neither helpful nor sympathetic, but they were rude. Other passengers boarding the flight noticed this and expressed their displeasure, this was even echoed by some of the security staff of the airport. My parents finally made it. I wanted to like Turkish Airlines, however my trip made it quite plain that this airline is only a premiere airline for those in Business and First class.

Outbound we were pushed back and told we'd be delayed an hour. Last time I flew this route with easy we were delayed 3 hours.

Sad to see how down the airline I have loved has gone. Aircraft was new and nice, seat pitch good and flight attendants very nice except one unfriendly steward. Free blueberry juice, water and coffee/tea offered. All other soft drinks and snacks for purchase. Like a low cost carrier but prices are different. You maybe don't need a food in three hours flight. Point is that you don't feel anymore with Finnair that it's quality airline. And my flight with BA from Helsinki to London was so much better. BA should not sell tickets to Finnair flights, service concept is so different. Also that took too long to sell food and drinks. There was during almost all flight trolleys on the aisle and was very difficult to visit restroom. Frustrating maybe to the cabin crew too. ",Economy,2

The programs available were generally sufficient. Emirates looks after the kids well, with our youngest receiving special attention when she got on board and the gift she received was far more imaginative than the usual set of crayons and a colouring book that most airlines go for. The kids meals was also a dedicated meal rather than an adult meal with a few tweaks, though it would be nice to see some healthier options available for kids meals. The headset provided actually fit our daughter. It's these small touches that make travelling with kids easier. The seats were roomy in width and pitch and the flight to FRA was only a third full so we had plenty of room to spread out.

Staff were uncommunicative, did not speak English to converse with international passengers and even though there were at least 6 staff at the desk, all were unhelpful. More interested in playing on their phones! Plane was delayed in Hongqiao for 4 hours. Staff did not know what was happening and had no idea when the plane would fly. When the plane did take off, they did not have my special meal, so I had very little to eat. Got to Guangzhou and only had 45 minutes to catch next flight. Got driven from domestic to international terminal and then had to run to customs/immigration - about 800 metres and then run to the plane about 800m again. No passenger carts provided. On the flight they also did not have my special meal available. I had booked and confirmed this 1 month in advance for all legs of my journey. So I had to pick what little I could eat and since I had missed my special meal on 2 flights I was pretty hungry and slept most of the time. Staff did not make any special effort to get me anything extra. On arrival into Auckland we found our luggage was left behind in Guangzhou. It took 2 days even though there are daily flights from Guangzhou. I was extremely disappointed with the service and the flights.

1461,tap-portugal,Stephen Henden,2015-07-02,"TAP are charging shockingly high business class prices on their route from Lisbon to Sao Tome. The flight time via Acra is almost 7 hours and in my ignorance and bearing in mind we paid more than £2000 per seat I thought I would get something approaching reasonable seats and service. TAP are using A320's on the route in European configuration. This means that business has little or no more leg room the only benefit being that the middle row of three is not filled. They maintain that the seats are wider but on both our flights were not. This may be OK for a 2 hour business class route in Europe but not on a long haul flight like this at the prices that are being charged. The service was lacklustre and staff seemed to have little interest, the food was OK but inadequate for such a long flight and I arrived at the end of the SAO-LIS tired, hungry and feeling that I had been badly ripped off. I appreciate that an aircraft the size of an A320 is ideal for this route but there is no reason why TAP cannot invest in re-configuring the aircraft into a more suitable layout. BA for example use the same aircraft on a 5 hours plus run to Beirut yet have proper business class sleep seats at the front of the aircraft. If they really cannot do this then charge a small supplement but do not con passengers into thinking they are getting good comfort and service. This is one of the worst airline experiences in relation to value I have had and frankly would have rather flown Ryanair. From the moment we checked in in Lisbon the approach was lackluster.

There was no entertrainment system, and the food was terrible. On the way home from Dublin, we were delayed by 14 hours because the plane we were supposed to be on had trouble leaving Toronto and there was no other plane.

1471,turkish-airlines,Gary Turner,2015-07-23,I have flown with Turkish Air on previous occasions and found them very good. However this experience was well below their usual good record. Firstly I have to comment on the Turkish Airlines business lounge at Istanbul which would have to be the best lounge anywhere. But unfortunately it's a rose amongst the thorns as the rest of this airport is just awful and unfriendly. Our problems started at boarding where there was no priority whatsoever - in fact we were the last to board. Then the seats in the Boeing 737 are the same as you would expect on a 1 hour flight - very difficult to sleep sitting up. And the chef was missing which is a point of difference for this airline. This was an 11 hour overnight flight so they really need to upgrade the business product. We mysteriously had a 1 hour stopover at some Russian airport on the way that I was not expecting and was not able to use the business lounge there (small as it was). Lastly out bags came out without any priority. So I was really wondering why I paid 3 times the economy ticket price. I have previously been a strong supporter of Turkish Airlines but they let me down badly on this route. I would still recommend them if the plane has lay flat seats in business.,Business,5

These two beverages are very dehydrating, and every flight I've ever been on always provides the flyer with water free of charge. The flight attendants were very unfriendly as well.

We were not informed as to what was going on and when asked if I would make my connecting flight in Dallas I was told that I would find out when I got there. When landing in Dallas I had an hour to get to my other flight (or so I thought). We sat on the runway for over an hour, which of course we were not informed as to what was taking so long. The only thing that made the flight bearable is the fact there was movie service from the flight from Dallas to Las Vegas ($8 for a movie). I attempted to just check in online for my flight leaving tomorrow morning only to find out it told me my request could not be processed and I had to check in at the airport. I called the customer information number listed on the website only to be told it wasn't processing because I did not have a seat on my connecting flight from Dallas to Monroe.

This is what led to it. I requested a gluten free diet weeks before my flight and received one on the flight to Panama (which was really a fruit plate). However, I was trying to explain to the male steward on flight heading into Port of Spain on 18th July 2015 that I was going to take a regular meal since I had not eaten in a long time. He just grew frustrated, maybe because he did not speak or understand English well, became angry and kept pointing to a paper saying that he had no name. I calmly said ok and accepted whatever was given - which I could not eat. I fell asleep not even knowing when my tray was taken away. As the plane landed I gave my 'Thank you' to the stewards as I passed. I noticed the male steward stopped speaking to his female coworker and glared at me.

Don't know if they'll let me check (am writing from a hotel near airport during my 24 hour ""layover""). Even better - flight crew was at baggage claim and unable to find accommodation for the night - so AA/US Airways not only jerking around customers but crew as well (not surprisingly).

Inflight service was about the same as other premium Asian airlines. Food selection and taste was okay, movie selection was typical near new movies and a few classics, with screen size was about the same as competitors. A big plus was noise canceling headsets on the TPE-LAX segment. Seat for Economy was good, for Premium Economy felt a bit uncomfortable - despite more leg and thigh room, when reclined, our legs are hung at the calf. A foot rest would be a good addition. Amenities was ok - you get your toothbrush set, comb, and slippers. You can ask for eye covers, ear plugs and other amenities. Blankets made with quality material. Toilets cleaned regularly and the amenities are complete: soap, air freshner, eau de toilette, lotion - refreshing citrus aroma. ",Premium Economy,9

1493,delta-air-lines,Brian Smith,2015-06-17,"For a short haul flight like this one (7-8 hours each way), I try and save money by not booking business class, rather ""economy comfort"" on Delta. As usual, the service is perfunctory, the food not bad in and out of Narita, the seat fairly comfortable, and the entertainment of good quality with lots of choices. No drama on either flight. My only complaint that has never been addressed properly with Delta over the years is the horrible state of the lavatories. They are always left to fester for entire flights. I have never once seen an FA go in one to clean one. Delta is not ""special"" compared to other international carriers, but it's adequate and they have treated me well in the Skymiles program so far.",Premium Economy,8

Seats were comfortable enough, they seemed to be the same as the one Lufthansa originally put on their planes and I guess everyone went with them. Arriving in Athens there was a delay of half an hour due to congested skies as its the summer peak time. Boarded on time again a friendly staff with a good plane. They are a great choice.",Economy,10
1495,hainan-airlines,Charles Qian Li,2015-06-19,"As a frequent Chicago-Beijing-route traveller, I know the available carriers quite well, Hainan, United, and American Airlines. Hainan flies this route with its Boeing 787. One thing I love the most about Hainan is that the toilets are always clean! Trust me when I say the sanitary condition of cabin toilets are important for people spending 12 hours or more on international flights, because you will use the toilets at least once. I was sitting in 40K, which is the first role of the second section of the Economy class cabin, and I saw the flight attendants cleaning the toilets on an hourly basis with air freshener. Although I was a little disappointed when Hainan changed its breakfast menu (it used to offer omelet and sausage on all international flights, which I think is the best in-flight breakfast I have ever had!), the food is still pretty nice and superior to other carriers. The flight also offers a self-service snack and beverage bar at the back. And if you have special requests, the flight attendants are always there to provide you with whatever you need. Inflight Entertainment, Hainan still has a long way to go. But I don't see it as a problem, because compared with the entertainment systems on other carriers (Air China, American Airlines, United, Delta, Air Canada), Hainan's still far more superior. Many hit shows and sitcoms are included.  One weakness which Hainan and all Chinese airlines all have is the language service. Although the captain spoke perfectly fluent English, some cabin members didn't. Foreigners may face difficulty understanding their safety instruction or communicating their needs. They still need to work on that.",Economy,9

Flight arrived early which made connection easier considering 15 min walk to gate. Had booked economy plus on Finnair leg. What a joke, don't book seats 22c,d,e or f you have an offset screen due to only being three seats in row in front. Screens were in two end seats of row in front which meant you were viewing at an angle if in two middle seats. End seats both had pull up screens which meant that because of the need to angle screen it was shining in my eyes which was very annoying when trying to sleep on the 12 hour flight. My screen kept shutting down every couple of minutes so I gave up. Staff were pleasant but overall the seats were uncomfortable, I should have saved my money and not gone economy plus.

Our flight was meant to depart Lagos at 12pm only to be told at 12:33 that the plane was been re-refuelled. After blankets were handed out, we were expecting the headsets to be handed out.

1498,jetstar-airways,G Pritchard,2015-06-20,"JQ30 on 16th June was my first flight on the new Dreamliner. In row 2 of Business Class, I had expected a comfortable ride notwithstanding the restriction of this budget carrier. There is an inherent design problem with JQ's configuration: Row 1 seats recline at an angle which allows good legroom but restricts Row 2 seats' access and space. When the seats in front were reclined as they were for the entire trip, the back of that seat was less than 30cms from my face with my seat in an upright position. I reclined my seat part way out of respect for the passenger behind whose seat in the last row of Business Class reclined to limited extent. This meant that I was trapped in my seat for the time that my fellow passenger was sleeping. The exterior of the aircraft has no window shade which means that even with the window tinted electronically, if you are on the sunrise-side of the craft, you have a mini heat radiator next to your face. Food on this service was minimal with none of the usual courtesy request to passengers to put their seats upright during service which meant that I ate in a space of less than 30cms. The food was basic at best and the staff virtually unseen throughout the flight as the three assigned to take care of 21 Business Class passengers spent most of the flight seated up front. I will not use this service to SEAsia again as Economy with carriers like Cathay is far more comfortable and better value.",Business,1

The boarding was chaotic and took a long time, as it appeared more passengers had to change seats. The seat I was put in was the most cramped one on the plane. Once aboard the plane I told the purser about the situation, she refused to believe me and went out of her way to deny I even paid for an EconomyComfort seat.

I did a two day layover in Iceland which I enjoyed. The food was good to excellent. I preordered each meal. The lamb was the best choice. I found the crew to be very pleasant and accommodating onboard. The 'less than good': Remote stands in Reykjavik. Not a problem arriving, but leaving was very uncomfortable. They loaded and loaded and loaded folks onto that bus. We waited and kept waiting with the door open and a cold gale coming through. Seriously? They couldn't get another bus? Finally, the flight from KEF to FRA was full in Saga Class with Icelandair execs and their spouses. They were some of the most obnoxious, demanding, and rude passengers I have ever encountered.

I signed up for email notification from Spirit Airlines and I checked my email before leaving the house to the airport – saw a notice of a delay in Chicago. Got to the airport and noticed the flight had been canceled. I asked about why no email notification, they said the flight was just canceled. They booked me the next day out (the only option!). I showed up at the airport the next day (again I checked my email – no notice) the flight was delayed – 3 hours! (they had to wait for the last flight attendant). At the airport I pulled up my reservation on the web site (manage travel) and found my flight was routed to Fort Lauderdale – Myrtle Beach – Boston. (again no email notice of route change!). Finally left Minneapolis 3 hours late and arrived Chicago. I could not find a service counter and all the gate counters were busy loading people. I finally grabbed a person and mentioned that I think my flight reservations had changed but I had no boarding passes - he did finally find my rerouted arrangements and printed boarding passes. Got on a plane with only 20 other passengers, the gate agent mentioned that the airline scheduled a new flight just for us! We got to Fort Lauderdale one hour after the flight to Myrtle Beach left (so wouldn’t you think the airline would have known that a special flight taking off when it did wouldn’t arrive in time to connect with the outgoing flight). There was 14 of us in the same situation (trying to get to Boston) and were told to go out of the secured area and talk to the supervisor at the ticketing desk. We all had to wait in line with customers checking in. We finally got a service rep that set us all up with hotel and food vouchers for the night and some were scheduled on a morning flight to Boston and some, myself included, were scheduled out at 8 pm to fly to Myrtle Beach to connect with a flight to Boston getting into Boston Thursday AM. The 3 of us that were on the evening flight asked to be put on the standby list for the morning flight out. We got to our hotel at 11pm and we signed up for a hotel shuttle at 5am the next morning. We (the 3 of us) got to the airport Wed. morning and were successful in getting a seat on the 8:50am flight to Boston which went well. A side benefit of being on standby is that all 3 of us got exit row seats – more legroom. We got to Boston by noon Wed. So my trip: MSP – BOS  Monday am to Wed noon.

I managed to prebook seats, luggage, check in online etc. It's a no frills airline but you are paying such great prices so you cannot complain. The cabin crew were friendly and did a good job on board. The only negative comment I can say is that they had ran out of Prosecco (except for 1 bottle) on both flights and we were sitting in Row 3! The bar seemed poorly stocked and on the return flight I heard that there was no hot food available. I am not surprised as the passengers were only getting off our aircraft 5 minutes before we boarded it to return home. I never saw an aircraft turned around so quickly in all my years of travel.

The direct route from LAX to DUB definitely filled a void since Aer Lingus pulled out several years ago. I would recommend this airline. The prices are reasonable and the service is fantastic. The hours of this flight are a little odd leaving LAX around midnight. The Dublin flight leaves for LAX at 6.15 am. If you can deal with those hours then this airline is the way to travel.

Excellent experience throughout. All flights on time. Staff alert, attentive and productive. Service and drinks world top class. Food amount and quality is significantly slipping but still acceptable. Because QR has recently done a lot of promotional sales, business class cabins are now full or almost full. However, service was still exhibited well and focused. I rate the B777-200 business class seat and cabin comfort high. However, the best seat and cabin among the 3 aircrafts tried was the A380: almost noiseless and with the luxury bar on the upper deck. FA tend not to chat with each other and keep themselves busy making a true effort comforting the pax – they are friendly and talk positively with most passengers. That’s the way! Of all sectors above only the DOH-CPH was in economy, of course a different ballgame with a slimmer hardware and software - but altogether the rating became equally high. Worst on the 787 is the extreme compacted seating which must be among the heaviest packed economy in the world – not much dreaming on that part of the Dreamliner, now I understand the nickname “Nightmare-liner”: If the person in front of you reclines you are forced to do the same unless you close your tray-table! In contrast, the following sector back from CPH-DOH was in the Dreamliner aircraft’s business class which offered a superb odysse, but still a bit below that of QR’s A380. Business class full but staff managed very well, high degree of attention and service. Al Mourjan lounge in DOH clearly 5 star, though too big to my taste. Lots of food in either buffets, a la carte. The bar on 1st floor offered 3 different, prestigious champagnes (I just checked and saw the bottles). From DOH-BKK in A380: faultless, quiet, lots of service and talkative FA’s.

Forget collecting miles, their program is terrible, especially if you want to collect flying with another sky team member. The food is lousy at best. The benefit is that they are the only airline flying from Guangzhou directly to the US.

My family of 4, including myself traveled to Texas to a ministry conference. I will be honest, we did not get to the airports in time therefore we missed our flights going and coming. The first error was us, we should have gotten there earlier. My overall concern was the extreme lack of customer service that displayed any concern to our dilemma. The inconsistency in the service was very obvious. There was two lovely ladies that did give a great effort of service to us, but this was well appreciated but it wasn't even enough to win our return. On top of the lack of customer service, all the other fees where really extreme. Please take in to consideration, if you want customers to be loyal and return, customer service is a must!",Economy,2

Around 2.30 Saturday afternoon I received a text stating that our flight had been cancelled and a website link. The link was for their main website and offered no options as to what to do. I immediately got on the phone to call them and had to wait an hour and 10 minutes on hold before someone could pick up. The lady I spoke to simply told me my flight had been cancelled. I responded by saying that's not a problem just put us on the next flight out this evening. I was told that the next flight out would be Monday afternoon (this is Saturday).

I came across some pretty negative reviews online and was apprehensive going into the flight. However, I must say that the flight far surpassed my expectations and I will be very likely to fly Norwegian again. I knew going into the flight that Norwegian does not offer complementary beverages or an in-flight meal without a hefty price, so I just made sure to grab a bite and bottle of water at JFK right before my flight and to pack my own little travel pillow (again, for $250 and a couple hours of layover saved by flying Norwegian, I can drop $10 on a sandwich before the flight and not starve, it is well worth it!). The flight was 20 minutes late boarding, though we actually arrived in Copenhagen on time. The flight itself was extremely comfortable. We boarded to music playing, they dimmed the lights quickly after take off, the cabin was pressurized at a lower altitude than most aircrafts are capable of which left me with very little jetlag, free and relatively fast wifi, and each seat was comfortable with it's own personal Android operating screen that contained several good movies & music albums to keep me entertained.

Enroute to the gate to get the Johannesburg flight we were informed by other passengers that the flight had left. Again there were no announcements. No Lufthansa representative was assigned to deal with passengers that were stranded. The group was split as some passengers did not have visas to enter Germany. After much walking and asking random people what to do, we found a service desk with staff willing to assist. This was also stressful as it was late and everyone was going off shift. The airport was near deserted except for the confused and stressed passengers, some of whom were travelling with small children. We were given a taxi, hotel and meal vouchers for the overnight stay.

We travel frequently nationally and internationally and have never had such poor customer service. Although you think you may be getting the best fare initially, they get you with the baggage, seat assignments, and treat you very poorly. We were carrying backpacks in order to save on having to check in bags, and had to pay $100 per bag at the counter before we boarded the plane. It wasn't so much paying the price as it was the way they treated us. Demanding and rude to not only us, but to other customers with the same challenge. On your vacation, you don't want to have poor customer service that puts a dent in the way you feel traveling. You want to have a nice experience. Its a 3 hour flight and you have to pay for snacks and drinks! On our 1 hour flight with Southwest and American, they treat you pleasantly and give complimentary drinks and snacks. The woman at the counter taking our tickets, as well as the attendants on the plane looked like they hated their job. The lady yelled at my husband to repack our bags and ""get it together"", on the plane we were seated separately and I asked politely to see if I could switch seats with someone and the attendant told me, ""just sit down"". Also, there are challenges with the online check-in that half the time works. When calling in, they also disconnect you, can't help you check in, and are rude.

At this point I thought if I set an account up online I may be able to view the ticket online and print it. I filled in the details online, was sent an email with a link in to complete the set up. Clicking the link did nothing. So, I revisited the site and attempted to use the details I had just used to log in. An error message something along the lines of 'account has not been recognised' was my reply. So, I attempted to sign up again. 'These details already have an active account' was my reply... So, I tried resetting my password, which I immediately got sent through to my email I'd registered. I then tried to log in again, 'the details you entered are not correct'.

The day we came home we arrived with more than ample time before the flight to get checked in etc. Upon arrival we were met with large queues, considering the majority of the check in gates are for them it amazed me, especially at a time when usually online booking can be done with other airlines so easily. The airport has an online check in set up inside so I thought I'd do this to dodge the queues. 2 terminals were switched off with some sort of fault. the third was on, I logged my details the flight details came up all was running smoothly and then, it crashed. After 70 minutes of waiting in line, we were told that our flight had a separate checking in gate around the other side of the main checking in gates and that the agent couldn't check us in. Nowhere had it been made clear that this would be the case. No notes on booking reference forms, no tickets (obviously by this point) nothing - after finding the desk that was relevant to us we then waited a further 30 minutes to get to the front of this queue. The checking in lady sadly had issues with her printer which delayed us further.

I went ahead and booked our flight and called the airline. They advised me to check in early and request the seat upon check-in. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 11.30pm and as early as 5pm we had checked in our baggage.

We had to stand in one long line to drop off checked bags, another line to pay extra fees and return to the 1st line to complete the bag drop process. During this ordeal, we were met with staff who were insolent (berating us in French) and clearly had no allegiance to Ryanair (giving confusing directions).

At least not for domestic flights departing Melbourne. Get there 45 minutes before your flight, flag a staff member and tell them your flight is boarding now and you'll get right up the front of the queue and wave bye bye to the poor sops who play by the rules.

Boarded a fairly new B737 - clean and tidy and in Business Class all seats had power. Offered a bar service as well as fresh fruit on the short sector to Zhengzhou and the aircraft stops here before carrying on to Shanghai. Transit process well organised and offered lounge usage - again, Chinese standard and WiFi (which is all I really needed) did not work. Staff were proactive and did try to resolve but not much else they could do. Full meal service on the second sector to SHA - proper menus and 3 entrée choices, whilst all Chinese were fairly agreeable to a western palate. Food quality was good and regular beverage services. Staff were proactive during both flights and language skills were decent for a domestic service.

The seat did not fully extend flat due to it not being operating properly. The connection time in FRA is not enough time although it is a legal connection in their system. One must give themselves at least 2 hours between flights. Condor have limited gates and the size of FRA requires at least 2 hours for connection. On our return, I was injured a day prior to our flight and we contacted Condor to reschedule our flight and to request a wheel chair and was refused due to their rules for needing at least 7 days notice for any request changes. Flying business class and not having any customer service was astonishing. We had to contact the airport to arrange our own services. When we arrived at the gate in FRA, we were told business class was oversold and we were asked to fly another airline to get home. We asked if wee would be in business class and if we would have seats together and would our luggage be on the flight. The Condor representative assured us all would occur. When we arrived at the other airline, we did not have seats in business class, we did not have seats together, and our luggage was not in their system.

The whole thing was a complete  shambles and there were some heated exchanges between passengers who tried to push in. We have seen this before at Madeira airport and it makes for a poor end to a nice holiday. Easyjet need to review their arrangements at this airport. The flight itself was uneventful on an older A320, left early and arrived early. The only slight disappointment was that there was only one refreshment run. Since they had run out of most snacks early on the first run perhaps they thought it wasn't worth doing a second (although a drink of some kind would have been welcome).

Cramped and uncomfortable seating, along with expensive food on board, this unfortunately becoming the norm for this level of airline, so no surprises. Returning (Heraklion to Manchester) however ended with further expense just prior to boarding. We checked the same bag for the hold as before no problem and carried the same bags, but afterwards we received very disorganised information from the easyJet staff at this airport. Waiting to board the plane at the gate we were singled out in the line by an particular easyJet staff member and to some extent made an example off. The issue initially involved my fiancée carrying an over the shoulder purse as this is apparently one extra piece of hand luggage. I myself had a cabin bag that has an additional over shoulder bag that attaches via a zip. Whilst both bags joined wouldn't fit in the individual persons size limit, the detachable bag is very small and although crammed full fits easily under the seat (as it did on the previous flight no problem). So detached now we had one bag, a small over the shoulder bag and my fiancée's purse. Both these two smaller items fitted together in the airlines cabin size limit (plus there was more than enough room left for a person to stand next to them). However this particular easyJet member of staff loudly and publicly stated that we had one too may cabin bags. We tried cramming the smaller purse into the other only to have the complaint that the zips were not fully closed. Stressed and feeling victimised at this point with a particularly unfriendly and inflexible staff member, along with feeling singled out, especially as a number of the other customers now going through the gate for boarding next to us carried multiple duty free bags each far larger than our additional 'bag', we were forced to concede to have the cabin bag placed in the aircraft hold to an additional €55 fee. Great end to a holiday. easyJet for us is not particularly good value for money when you consider the hidden charges (charged to check in online also now I recall), inflexibility and lack of customer service (for at least one particular member of staff). Uncomfortable, no entertainment, limited and lastly not that particular inexpensive flight. We hope to fly with a more reputable airline in the future.",Economy,3

We were supposed to catch flight AC 852 from Calgary to London, however, there was a 2.5 hour delay and accordingly there was a risk that we would miss our flight from London to Cairo. I went to the Air Canada customer service, who told us that if we missed our flight we would be compensated. However, on flight from Calgary to London I was disappointed once again, I asked the flight attendant for a can opener because I wanted to open my baby's formula but they said they didn't have one. It was very inconvenient considering that the flight was 9 hours long. They didn't give me extra food or any baby food (which was supposed to be provided since they knew there was going to be a baby on board). When we got to London at 2.57 pm, we, obviously with no surprise, missed our next flight that was planned to depart at 3pm. We were booked for the flight that leaves at 10.30 pm, thus making us stay at the airport for 7.5 hours! We were treated with no respect whatsoever. We were just given vouchers and told that was all they could do for us.

It was funny to see such old Hollywood movies available on the Rouge Player (one of the movies was Never Ending Story!).

This meant every passenger on the left side who needed to use the rest room (which could be several times on a 14 hour flight) would have to cross the bulkhead seats (which is where I was sat) at the front of the cabin. If you plan to sleep do not select these seats as you will be knocked by passengers trying to cut across to use the rest room. I also felt CP have tried to fit too many seats in the bulkhead row of the middle section. I feel the end two seats impede the aisle from business class so when catering came through the curtain from business to premium there is a good chance your left leg might take a bump. Three seats in this row would probably be a better option. The seats could have been a little comfier for the money paid.

The cost of the tickets was outrageous for a 2 hr flight but it was a present for my daughters so I reluctantly paid it because it had desirable departure times and no layovers. The flight was to leave at 9.35 am. They texted at 5 am to say the flight was delayed until 11.11. Just as I was walking out the door I noticed another text saying it was now going out at 12.15. As long as I had time I decided to check in online. There I was informed that my flight had been cancelled but 'don't worry, we've rebooked you on a different flight. Yes, one that leaves at 5.03 pm, lays over in Cleveland and doesn't arrive in NY until 10.00 pm.

We brought her to the gate in Chicago in our own, personal, transport wheelchair. The attendant at the plane took the wheelchair and gave us a tag. In Amman, we asked for the wheelchair but it was not given to us. They said it would be taken to Jeddah. Instead, an airline wheelchair was used to transport her to our connecting flight. When we arrived at Jeddah, it was not there, and the Royal Jordanian staff were not helpful. We filed a claim for lost baggage as soon as we could. They have not gotten back to us, and will not answer their Chicago phone. I cannot begin to express how dangerous it was to transport a 92 year old without her chair.

1611,ba-cityflyer,R Simon,2015-06-22,"EDI-LCY on Embraer 190 operated by BA City Flyer in Economy – short domestic hop back to London City Airport. Flight departed on time but could not land at City due to high winds. Pilot tried twice but had to abort the landing and finally diverted to London Southend. During the whole time good information from the flight deck about what was going on. Once the plane landed in Southend, crew was well prepared giving out information during the disembarkation process about the options. Basically, passengers could use a coach to be organized by BA to LCY or people could opt to take public transport to London and have the costs reimbursed later. We opted for the Greater Anglia service to Liverpool Street Station which runs regularly and worked well for us. As for the regular service on board, full bar service and snacks were offered. FA’s were friendly. Service in Edinburgh was hassle free. We had no checked luggage and check in kiosks worked fine with no lines. Terraces Lounge in EDI was quite spacious and comfortable with some food and a nice selection of drinks. Excellent for a regional airport. Especially given the fact that the situation was weather related and clearly not BA’s fault, I felt that BA did everything possible to make the experience as hassle free as possible. Situations like these, when not everything goes as planned, tell a good airline apart from the rest.  While the actual reclaiming process over BA’s website took longer and was less straightforward than expected, it finally worked and the difficulties involved were related BA’s procedures and information regarding requirements posted on the website. However, the agents worked with us to finish the claim and were actually helpful during the process . (Oneworld Sapphire)",Economy,10

What started out as a long 2 leg trip, slowly got longer. I then discovered that the boarding had moved gates. No announcement. I discovered it by chance walking past the departure board. Boarding was a joke. People were pushing in, the staff had no control or idea. The new gate was a transfer by bus. Followed by a 50m walk in the rain and up the stairs. The airconditioner on the plane did not work on boarding, we sat for over 30 mins sweating. When it finally took off, it was 4 hrs 20 mins late. This put us in Singapore at 1.45am with a 6 hours wait for the next flight. When we landed, they offered a hotel, 30 mins taxi ride there and 30 mins back.

After 10 years of flying PIA's Business Class, you get used to the CIP lounge in Islamabad, which, although renovated and refurbished, still lacks a lot when compared to Emirates, Qatar Airways or Etihad. After the long wait, the boarding started slightly behind schedule. Since Islamabad Airport doesn't have jetways, we boarded via stairs, and as we entered the aircraft, I immediately realised that the AC's weren't on. We had to sit in this inferno for about 20-30 minutes before the engines were started. Post-takeoff, menus were distributed and the food trolley was rolled out. The food was delicious, and I even opted for seconds. After lunch, I realised that the IFE wasn't working, and when I flagged down a stewardess to ask why the IFE had failed, her response was ""technical failure"" and was not very helpful. The rest of the flight was uneventful. Business Plus passengers were allowed to de-board first. All in all, not the business class you'd expect from other carriers, but it is somewhat value for your money. I probably would recommend PIA to my friends and family.",Business,8

Singapore Airlines wouldn't even admit Scoot Biz passengers, but instead referred us to another lower market lounge. The seats only reclined 8 inches and the leg support did nothing. I asked for 2 pillows to support my back and was told I had to pay for them. That was when the staff told me that it was not Business Class but Premium Economy.

In this case it was the worst flight ever in terms of customer service, meals availability, and in-flight entertainment not functioning.

Check in service in Manila for the outbound flights to Paris was good - efficient and courteous. It was the opposite in Paris for the return. The check in staff was rude. The same thing with the security staff who man the line of passengers reporting for check in.

Coming back a bonus was that even for domestic-international if you have more than 6 hours wait (we had 12 hours) they put you up in a hotel room for free including transfers even during the day. You go to international check in, find G17 which is opposite the G's for check in and they check your details and then escort you onto a bus for your transit hotel. Bonus.

The chilli prawns and rice out of London were excellent but a Western style chicken dish from Hong Kong was bland. In general, I think they create better Asian dishes.

As a pre dinner drink I enjoyed trying a couple of their signature cocktails (different option on different routes). Boarding was easy, once you found the right line. The lounges in Hong Kong were good but busy. I especially liked the shower facilities and the made-to-order catering. But signage for the lounges was dire, so I struggled to find the one I was looking for at times. The lounges in London and Melbourne are also very small with no views, so I found them quite boring.

When you add up the flight, extra costs ($3 for a seat selection, $25 for a carry-on bag, $30 for a checked bag, and $4 for a soda or $6.99 for a beer), I really didn't save anything by flying Frontier. I am most surprised that Frontier apparently charges $50 more for Row 13. It seems very unfair the only row that reclines is Row 13 and anyone seated on Row 14 gets a seat back in there face. I gave it a try, but I will not make that mistake again. Frontier may be a discount carrier, but they are not the cheapest once you start adding in all the extras. Buyer beware.",Economy,1

1651,spirit-airlines,Andy Miller,2015-06-17,"I read past reviews and learned that you need to read their guidelines in advance. I avoided the $100 fee to check in at the gate but still had to pay somewhere between $40 - $50 just for a seat and a carry on bag. Simply getting a seat is extra - this was still OK for me, the total price was still cheap considering I booked the flight a couple days before it left. After reading the reviews I was fully anticipating a 1.5 hour delay, or more. Somehow a miracle occurred and our flight left only 20 minutes late - and we made up those 20 minutes on the flight back. However, flying out of LAX I looked at every other scheduled departures for Spirit and all of them were delayed by at least 2hours. I truly believe that people only complain when things go wrong - I thought maybe this airlines bad reviews are simply because those who get to where they're going with no hiccups never bother writing reviews. With that in mind I had every intention of writing a review, no matter how good or bad the flight went. My flight was good, but the fact that all other flights were delayed by that much scares me. I overheard some of their announcements on further delays, and no explanation was given. I'm not going to fly Spirit again purely for that reason. You know something's wrong when an airline can scare away a traveler for reasons that didn't affect their own flight.",Economy,6

1654,srilankan-airlines,P Elliott,2015-07-03,"We checked in at Hong Kong airport quickly and easily. Issued boarding passes and lounge invite. That was the Plaza Premium lounge. A lot of airlines use this lounge so there is a separated area for us airline customers. It is important to ask about that, as the normal part gets quite crowded. The airline reserved area has alcoholic drinks and better quality food. The main area has more substantial food. You can go from one area to the other. Our flight was delayed an hour in Bangkok, so we had plenty time to investigate the lounge. Boarding the flight was done in a hurry to try and make up time. Unfortunately, Hong Kong airport is a busy one, so we had to wait for a new take off slot. In the end, we were about 90 minutes late for take off. These things happen. The flight was smooth and comfortable. SriLankan business class is one of the best in terms of friendly service, good food and drinks. The A/V offering has been boosted in the last year, so now there are over 100 movies. Now nearly all business flights have fully reclining to flat bed seats. On arrival we were issued with priority arrival passes. That saved a few moments as immigration wasn't busy at 10pm. Our bags arrived in minutes and we were out of the airport and in a taxi. By that time the traffic into the city had thinned out, so we made up a bit of time there.",Business,10

Wine glasses were never less than half full and empty plates cleared in seconds. Truly five stars. All legs were on the new business seats which was a pleasant change en route to Sydney.

Biggest let down was the Delta flight from SFO to LA. Meant to depart at 7pm. Took off at 8.30pm. My wife had the same experience a week later. That meant that the transfer time at LA was impossibly short. I had to literally find my way out from the Delta terminal and walk on the side walk to the the Virgin Terminal. That is a good 20 minute walk. There was no assistance available at all. Half a dozen of us made our own way. The had to go through security again which is a pain. Made it to the boarding gate when they were boarding only because the Virgin plane was late. Hold luggage didn't make it. The Delta link up with Virgin is a disaster. Had I known! The A340 is crammed in the economy. Legroom very tight for tall people. And the Entertainment system packed up, so the whole 11 hours were difficult to pass. Service is okay. Nothing to brag about.

The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up.

Our flight from Toronto to Glasgow was pretty uneventful. Our return flight was also uneventful, thankfully. I appreciate the lighting and ambient music that seems to play as boarding and de-planing takes place. It can really add to a zen atmosphere and help people who might be having some pre-flying jitters. One thing to note, Air Transat: get your food situation together! Each flight, we ended up basically getting the worst they had to offer meal-wise because none of the decent food was left as everyone before us had opted for it. I was not at all impressed by this. We booked seats towards the back of the plane to avoid screaming children as best as we could, only to suffer as far as meal options went. Be prepared to need more of the food you know people prefer.

The cabin looked dingy and in need of a good clean. The cabin staff were are jaded as the furnishings. No sooner had we left the ground, than everyone was ordered - and I mean ordered - to close their window blinds, and they had to remain closed for the duration of the flight. So much for having a window seat. At one point, while going to the washroom, I literally had to jump out of the way of one of the cabin staff who was heading in the opposite direction, and I never received so much as a ""thanks"" as he barged past. The meals were served with all the enthusiasm of a billionaire serving in a soup kitchen - thankfully it was all over quickly. The food itself was ok - passable for economy class. Overall, this was grim. I'm seriously trying to decide whether to give up on Cathay Pacific after this. It's a shame - this used to be a great airline to fly with, but now it seems they're only interested if you travel in one of the premium cabins (I'm speaking from experience).

Third segment was also a short one from YHZ to YQY, operated by Jazz on a 30 years old DeHavilland DHC8-100 (Dash8) turboprop. Cabin attendant was friendly and served drinks and snacks.

Cabin service and food quality were good - with one of the best breakfasts we have had in the air - a delicious fruit muesli followed by a 'full english' which was hot and tasty. On this overnight flight, sleep was difficult mainly due to the narrowness of the seats. BA should provide a mattress 'topper' as many other airlines offer to enhance sleep comfort. Fair value for money proposition.",Business,6
1690,british-airways,Linda Wilson,2015-07-27,"I am a very frequent long haul traveller and although I will often choose the Asian carriers (e.g. Singapore Airlines, JAL, Cathay) over British Airways, being based in London means that I do often fly with BA. I find BA's long haul business class offering though innovative when it was launched in the 90s has now been way outclassed by many of its competitors. The seats don't quite lie flat (and it's not unusual to get a broken seat) and half the passengers have to go backwards and climb over other passengers to get out - I can't think of any other major airline that has this any more in business class. I am told by a BA contact that they considered changing the configuration for the A380s, but didn't in the end. Worst of all, I find the onboard service incredibly inconsistent - most often it's a little begrudging, occasionally it is excellent and sometimes it is downright awful. I was particularly annoyed at my customer service experience on a flight from LHR to Tokyo Haneda, when settling down in my seat, I looked down to find a dirty napkin, used earplugs and toothpick and significant quantities of broken glass around my feet (good job I hadn't taken my shoes off at this stage). My husband flagged down a member of cabin crew, who said she would come and clear it, but didn't. I flagged down the Cabin Services Director who did bring a dustpan and brush and said he would report it. Upon my return, I complained to BA. After three weeks, they deigned to reply, but it was on the lines of 'our cabins are always cleaned to the highest standards, we are sorry you didn't find this to your liking' - effectively implying that I was making a fuss over nothing.

The aircraft had overhead screens but they were only really used for the safety video (which curiously they only do in English and then ask passengers who speak one of their three main languages to ask the crew if they have questions). Strange croissant with a pretzel coating (but in my past experience Swiss food is not nice, even in business) and wide selection of drinks including alcohol. I had flown out on Austrian and the quality of Swiss is just a couple of notches higher. I did check in online but the Swiss website sends you to Lufthansa for some reason.

On the bright side, she gave us a priority tag for our baggage. The problem didn't stop there. Even our in-flight experience was hell. The food was far from edible. It was my first time to encounter a long-haul flight where you have to purchase snacks for a minimum of $8.99. There were no individual screens for entertainment and the wifi wasn't working properly.

1696,qantaslink,Jarryd Cahill,2015-07-15,"Being the first time flying with QantasLink, I was eager to see how standards compared with big brother Qantas. Airport Check In and security was all smooth through Brisbane. It was once I stepped on board that I noticed me and my colleague had the worst seats possible on the plane. Row 25 (back row near the toilets) and seats E and F which had no width and felt almost prison like. In addition to this the Boeing 717 has tail mounted engines which made the flight quite noisy - especially when trying to talk or listen to the cabin crew. Would recommend people sitting in rows 20 and forward to avoid this issue. Inflight services by Cabin Crew were excellent. Great breakfast options and Drinks. Cabin Crew were constantly looking to top up water. No IFE made the 3 and bit hour journey drag on - considering we had read that iPads were offered on this aircraft? I think for the money paid for these tickets some IFE needs to be offered. Aircraft arrived slightly late which was confusing as we took off early - but the delay was not an issue.

Priority boarding poor at Dubrovnik, all put on a bus to be taken to the aircraft. Cabin crew not as freindly on the return journey. Both flights about on time.

We then had to re-queue at check-in for over an hour and a half, staff were rude, brusque and aloof. Told that our only options were to cancel altogether or fly 9.5 hours later to Heathrow via British Airways. As we only had 3 nights in New York we would lose a third of our trip. We asked to come back a day later so we would actually get the trip that we had paid for, meaning adding on the day we lost onto the end of our holiday but they wouldn't honour this. We had to pay for our own additional night at the hotel in New York which they gave us 15 minutes to decide and organise.

Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again. Only negative point is arriving late in MIA there are hardly any Delta agents around (It's an AA airport!), so rebooking and hotel accommodation was tricky to figure. The Lost Luggage staff were very nice in fixing this quickly",Business,8

The food on board was slightly overpriced although that was to be expected and I was happy with my mobile connections while on board. My flight was only a 2.5 hour journey although the seats were uncomfortable they were tolerable for that amount of time.

Flight was at 10.05AM and arrived early at 7AM Noi Bai Airport to avoid the morning traffic. We were refused a check in, returned at 8AM. Self-Check in didn't work - bar code scanner wasn't available. Had no choice but to ""line up"" with Vietnamese people - who don’t know what the word “queue” means. Be prepared for people shamelessly cutting in line, squishing between you and the counter and crawling under the stanchion. Pushing you away and even if you are at the check in counter, standing just next to you. Vietjet encourages the behavior because the staff at the counter try to serve 3 people at once, leading to chaos and frustration. I am a frequent low cost flyer, never had problems with my luggage. However, my 8.5kg cabin bag was ""too heavy"" and lady at the counter wanted to count all my bags: my purse, my boyfriends camera bag, etc. She wanted me and my boyfriend to take only one bag each on the plane. I told her that this is ridiculous and we didn't have any problems in BKK, and no other airline does this. She couldn't speak English. Made us pay 330 000 VND for one bag check-in. Moved to our gate, realized during boarding that the plane was a n old  BH Air plane from Ukraine. Plane in Bangkok was a new A320-300. Very uncomfortable and I couldn't sleep because Vietnamese people and FA kept running around, bumping into my aisle seat. Every seat was taken, plane was super full and loud. Food I pre-booked was gross, so I asked the FA politely to put it away so I can put up my tray and have more space. She simply said: ""Later.""

We went upstairs, fortunately there was an escalator there, ate and came back to find nowhere to sit, and no new information. We went back upstairs, and 30 minutes later were approached by a young man with a wheelchair. He did not speak English, but informed my companion the plane had left without us. Finally, they gave us a ticket to Bangkok and I had to pay for a hotel and he flights to Chiang Mai - about $400. Through it all the ground staff was rude, inconsiderate and unresponsive.",Business,1

No announcement was made about this at any stage so we sat and waited expectantly. It landed 30 mins before take-off time so pretty happy to be only 25 mins late leaving. Flight was very smooth. Coffee/ tea served but very limited options for food to purchase if you wanted. Slightly concerned about the continual loud clunking noises coming from bottom of plane as we landed and the rather high-pitched squeal that accompanied us from the runway all the way to the gate. Can't complain too much as it was cheap and got me there, but I did leave the plane feeling a bit uneasy.",Economy,5

The flight attendants were rude, the meal was tasteless and was served 1hr 45mins after take off (on a night and transatlantic flight they should be much faster like other airlines). They took my plate back 1.5 hours after I received it. The seats are uncomfortable if you are more than 1m90 tall. No individual TV screens. You have to pay in order to have a headset.

When doing the online check in, we realized that Cathay Pacific had decided to change our seating. Of course they did not have the courtesy to inform us up about this to give us the chance to cancel the tickets and travel with another airline. So, Cathay Pacific had decided to split our family up. 1 adult is seated with 2 kids and 1 adult is seated somewhere completely different - 21 rows apart, to be precise. We found this out after normal office hours and then discovered a that Cathay Pacific only has reservations desks (as opposed to customer services desks) that you can call. Could not get their international 24 hour number to Work. Tried their Hong Kong number but after spending 15 minutes on hold I hung up. Next morning called the local reservation office in Zurich. Sorry sir, can't help with seat assignment it is a different system but you can do it yourself online (had already explained that we tried this but there were no 4 free seats together or near each other) or ask at the chek-in at the airport. As any family reading this can probably imagine, we arrived completely tired to our holiday after the long flight after plenty hassle of shuffling 2 small children back and forth in the cabin between mummy and daddy at mean times, toilet times, crying times etc. Now, we will see about the return flight after which we shall never set foot on Cathay Pacific again.",Economy,1

Then onboard old aircraft with no video seats, they sell DVD player for 8 euros but they had not enough for everyone so only the seats in the front could buy it - it is a very long flight so without entertainment it is even longer.

1738,china-eastern-airlines,A Malkowski,2015-06-19,"Vancouver to Beijing and Shanghai to Vancouver with 3 domestic flights: Beijing to Xi'an; Xi'an to Wuhan and Chongqing to Shanghai and was mostly satisfied. The long haul flights had pillows, blankets and headsets prepared on each seat. Three meals were provided with some choice and were decent by airline standards. A glass of wine was included with the main meal. Water was offered on a regular basis. Tea, coffee and soft drinks also available. Good selection of Chinese, International and Hollywood movies as well as games, e-books and other entertainment. On arrival in Shanghai Pudong we learnt that our ongoing flight to Beijing had been cancelled due to bad weather. Although we were transferred to an earlier flight we had to collect our luggage and collect new boarding passes which had already been prepared. This process was somewhat confusing and the boarding passes lay on the counter like a deck of cards with passengers randomly going through them to find their own. The information board showed that the new flight was delayed with no ETD or whether it would even be leaving that day. A rep came to explain the situation. He spent 10 minutes giving a Chinese explanation and in English, simply said we do not know. Suddenly he received a call on his mobile and said we may be boarding. After a mad rush to the gate it transpired that this was not the case after all and everyone returned to what seats were available, or the floor. Half an hour later the flight was officially called and we were on our way. The shorter, domestic flights offer food service but no entertainment. On one occasion we experienced a 2 hour delay after we had boarded the plane, due to a sudden storm. Dinner was served during this delay, before take off, and was a good use of time.

The first thing to do is relocate the Media box away from the under seat area. Having my one foot out in the isle was not only a safety hazard but not fun to be kicked and bumped into because I could not move my feet if placed under the seat. I was sitting next to a larger man who encroached into my seat space. I believe the seat is about 17"" across. Seat pitch minimal but no different to other airlines. Service was very friendly, top notch. Noticeably better than US airlines. Food was disappointing.

Food on offer was minimum but it was a hot dish which was better than the sandwich offerred on Lufthansa. Transfer in Zurich was smooth as usual. Zurich to London City flight was operated by Helvetic. A bit disappointing as the plane looked old and the crew were not as groomed as the Swiss flight.

The cabin crew shut the curtains at the front and that was it. They spent the rest of the flight chatting with each other. We were thirsty, hungry and cross by the time we landed.

Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time. I would recommend this airline if the price is good for a C class cabin but interiors need upgrading.",Business,8
1749,condor-airlines,Margot Senula,2015-07-22,"I have been flying for over 50 yrs and this was the worst airline experience. This flight was scheduled to leave at 8.45 pm on June 27th, 2015. Approximately six weeks prior to departure our travel agent informed us that the return flight would be later which we were ok with. When we received our new itinerary on May 9th we were shocked to find that our departure had also changed to 11.45pm on June 27th. This delay, which our travel agent said she was not originally informed of, of course negatively impacted our travel plans and hotel reservations. Six weeks prior to departure it was of course also impossible to find a reasonably priced flight for the same date for eight people. The plane arrived at the gate late (no passengers disembarked) but we watched through the window as large crates of cargo were unloaded from the plane. As midnight came and went we asked the gate staff if we were going to make our connecting flight in Frankfurt – they reassured us we would. We asked multiple times over the next hour and each time got the same assurance. They then informed us that the flight was delayed because they needed to clean and provision the plane for our flight. The time approached 1 am (technically the next day June 28th) before boarding commenced. The pilot and head flight attendant at the plane entrance again reassured us that we would make our connecting flight no problem. They then informed us that the delay in the flight was due to refueling. We didn’t take off until 1.30 am. Upon arriving in Frankfurt there was no direction on how to catch our connecting flights we had originally scheduled an hour and 25 minute to make our connection – but of course we left an hour and 45 minutes behind schedule. We parked at Concourse A and unloaded. We had to board the airport buses which took us to the other side of the airport – Concourse C. No one met the 15-20+ passengers who had our connecting flight to Munich or provided direction. We found our departure gate, back at Concourse A, and ran through the airport to try to make our flight – other passengers were with us. They rushed us through the security checkpoints but we were still delayed. We arrived at the gate to have Lufthansa inform us that the flight left 5 minutes ago and it was not their fault. Apparently Condor had not communicated with them allowing the 15-20 passengers to make our connection. We felt the Condor staff who promised we would make the connection had lied to us and worse yet made no provision for the connection. We then had to go across the whole airport once again to the Condor desk. Where upon the desk staff made us feel like it was our fault we missed the flight, were unfriendly, unsympathetic and made little attempt to find a solution except for a flight to Munich 3+ hours later – which again would have interfered with our hotel reservations. Unwilling to wait or delay any longer our family discussed the situation and we made arrangements with our rental car to start our trip and drive from Frankfurt. But Condor then proceeded to lose our bags for an hour and a half and said they would not forward our bags if they could not find them. We got to our destination at 1.30 am. We had issues on our return flight as well - a gate change less than hour before the flight with no notice.",Economy,2

On the flight from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro, they lost our luggage. I cannot overstate how rude and unhelpful their customer service representatives were on this issue. On 12 June our flight from Zanzibar to Kilimanjaro was cancelled without explanation. We were lucky enough to be put on the next plane - others were not so lucky. Again, cannot overstate how rudely everything was handled. The next day, our flight from Kilimanjaro to Nairobi was also cancelled without explanation. This knocked out all our connecting flights to South Africa and we had to spend 14 hours in Kili airport with no meal vouchers or any kind of explanation.

The customer service is shockingly bad, both at check in and on board. The staff on board treated us terribly. Dished out food and drink to us as if we were in a prison, one even nudged me on the shoulder with the tea tray he was carrying. When I asked (several times) for a sandwich for my 3 year old, I got a tuna and cheese sandwich, loosely wrapped in cling film, which looked like it had been home made from a kids lunch box and had enjoyed many hours of sitting in warm air. Suffice to say, I did not deem it safe to feed to my daughter. Picture attached! I cannot express how awful these flights, bar one (we did one business class flight), were. The entertainment system was very out of date with bad pictures and a very small selection of movies and games. I understand that flying economy means that we may not enjoy many of the frills offered by more premium seats, as I often use budget airlines, but this is on a another level! Even service offered on airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet far exceeds that received from Vietnam's national airline. What a bad representation of Vietnam. I will never fly with this airline again, even if it means paying more to use an alternative carrier.

The lounge in Reykjavik is quite good and the Reykjavik Airport is very nice. There are plenty of negatives with this airline. First of all the planes are quite old and it shows. Staff can be unfriendly if not outright rude. I had numerous delays and one time I got stuck at Reykjavik airport for an entire day.

Meanwhile, Brussels weather deteriorated giving us the pleasure of being stay stuck inside the aircraft until 20.15. I agree that bad weather in Brussels Airport is not the airlines responsibility, but if the crew had been on time, the pilot wouldn't have lost the slot and the rest of our journey would have continued normally.

The way this airline does seating is entirely asinine - you can book your flight at any time, but you have to wait until within two weeks of the flight to actually pick your seats. The flight was very loud and the lights and air conditioners at each seat were difficult to adjust, at some points feeling as if they would break if you tried to point the air toward you. Snacks all have to be paid for rather than being included, which also seems ridiculous when the flight already costs so much.

In order to use this package I had to actually call them instead of doing it online. Unlike most airlines online check-in is available only 4 hours before departure. The online check-in process is the worst I have seen - you cannot check in everyone on your booking at the same time, you have to do it for each family member, even for children. At the airport it was not too bad, just like other budget airlines. The check-in line was long but that's where the premium package is useful. The flight from Montreal to Holguin was OK. The aircraft was relatively large but the seat spacing was extremely small. We are not talking about the centimeters between your knees and the seat in front of you, we are talking about the centimeters between your nose and that seat. If the passenger in front of you reclines, you simply have no choice but to recline too. If you go to the bathroom and they start serving food or drinks - you will not get back to your seat until the cart passes it. Food and drink service is ok. I have to admit that the food was provided and it it was quite good. The flight back (WG645) was terrible. First, the drink service was worse, they did not even have coffee. Next, the cabin temperature. It was very cold. Considering that the families were flying from Cuba (+35C) with kids it was just terrible. Many people complained but nothing was done to make it warmer. Next, the flight was late to Montreal by ~40 minutes, it could not get to the gate.

I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin. BA staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here.

Flight crew was fine and professional. Inflight entertainment was fine but new movie selection was small. Cabin and seats were clean and neat. Inflight kit consisted of socks, ear plugs, mask, pen and tiny toothpaste and brush.  They offer pillows and blankets. But although the seats are wider, they weren't easy to get in and out of, and not just us a number of passengers contorted just to get out. The meals were fine, though served on a tiny tray loaded with food, the meal was pretty good. Not a lot of choices, to London, beef or pasta, from London back to LA, it was beef or fish. It was hot and there was a lot of food, a salad, small  cheese and  crackers. Roll butter and dessert but I'm not sure I'd say it was what BA's advertisement claims. It didn't feel it was a premium meal. They also served snacks but it was flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snacks. The entire plane was dark. The second meal was a breakfast, but not especially appealing. On the return to LA, it was a very odd casserole, rather dry and bland. The flight was smooth and arrived on time, coming back we were an hour late waiting as the pilot informed us of sixty passengers arriving late from Germany. They lost one of our suitcases enroute, we arrived on Thursday afternoon, the bag was delivered late Friday night to our hotel, no offer to help with expense of having to buy what was needed until bag was found. Not even an email or text, we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight Friday, we weren't notified by BA until Saturday afternoon. We ended up spending quite a lot buying shirts, underwear and shorts to get by. If we'd known they had found the bag we wouldn't have spent the money. Poor communication on their part.

The B787 seats are not as good as A380, but okay for the shorter flight to Doha. The window shades in this 787 aircraft are rubbish, and they do not block out the sun as was promised when Boeing were advertising the benefits of the plane. The A380 was so much better, nice and spacious and seats very comfortable. IFE is not very different to Emirates or Singapore Airlines that I flew last time, don't understand why everyone raves about Emirates because they just have a huge library of ancient, 2nd rate films. Food was good, not the best but certainly good for Economy cabin trip. Cabin staff were great on both flights, better for DOH-BKK where they were chatty and friendly. Return in 10 days flying out of Singapore and looking forward to getting on their A350 I have read so much about.

They shifted me to a flight that would have left me stranded in Kuala Lumpur, unable to catch my connecting flight to Europe. However, they
did offer me a full refund, which was processed quickly and efficiently. As I was based in northern New South Wales at the time, I booked a flight from Gold Coast instead. The online check-in was quick, however I was placed in a middle seat. On board the plane, let's just say I was lucky enough to have some pretty powerful sleeping pills. The Economy seating on the A330 was cramped and narrow - something which you don't want when you're 6'1"" tall. Additionally, you have to pay for entertainment - something you don't usually expect on a 9-hour flight. The cabin crew could not make themselves clearly understood either. I will say a few good things about the airline, though. I had ordered a nasi lemak when I booked the flight - this is unbelievably delicious and thoroughly recommended. Also, AirAsia X is incredibly good value for money. In conclusion, I would recommend AirAsia X, so long as you have patience and the gumption to pre-order food.",Economy,4

The ground staff at Itami helped arrange my partner and I to be on the next flight out from Itami to Haneda, even though they could have asked me to travel to Kansai for my flight instead.

AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes, the rain did cause part of the delay, but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation.

Inflight entertainment was alright, but do take note to always unplug the headset whenever you get out of your seat. It damages easily if it gets caught on something. I had to change 2 headsets because of that, because being in a aisle seat, you have to get off when someone wants to use the lavatory, thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get up from your seat. Service was alright. I requested for eye shades, and it came about 1hr later, crew must have forgotten about my request. I didn't pursue it as I thought I could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie. In terms of food, it was appalling and greasy.

On HKG-LHR leg though they did not have enough mid-flight meals for all passengers, which I find hard to fathom given people are paying thousands for the ticket and the meal only costs Cathay a few quid to produce. They should overstock, not understock the flight. The other complaint on the trip was the regionally configured plane from NRT-HKG is a poor excuse for business class on a four hour leg. No reason not to run flat beds on that route, considering the importance of it and the fact that some flights are overnight. Won't pay for that again.

Finally I did make my final connection, and on this one (the 12-hour flight), my entertainment system didn't work, this included my call button, so I couldn't even get assistance and the crew didn't bring around drinks once during the entire flight (except with the 2 meal services).

After almost 20 minutes and about 40 plus customers all standing about awaiting bags, several customers like myself started making approaches to Jetstar. Apparently the machine that unloads luggage from the plane is broken and they didn't have another.

Jetstar never made any PA announcements, nor did they apologise when we finally got luggage 1.25 hours after the flight landed. They aren't a cheap airline to fly on anyway.

Water was available free any time. We took our snacks onboard and there wasn't a mention from any staff about that. Then again, the snacks made no mess. We used Scoot in style at Singapore airport. Incidentally we used Krisflyer points to get a Scoot voucher and used the voucher to pay the  Scoot in Style upgrade after making our booking. You need to do all that on the website beforehand. It worked perfectly. So we arrived at check-in 3 hours ahead of the Bangkok flight and got about 2 full hours in the SATS lounge. It was worth it as you can eat and drink a lot during 2 hours! The Bangkok flight was pretty full as it was a public holiday, but Biz class was ok. Again we were offered any drink to go with our upgraded meal.  We got a seat between us empty.

Alcoholic drinks and a sandwich (even a pre-ordered vegetarian one for my companion) were offered - basic, but hey, that's the way it is nowadays. Small downpoint: the very interestingly looking in-flight magazine was almost exclusively in Russian language.

Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard  and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft.

A319 on FRA-TUN had business class seats , the crew was always on hand and the lounge in FRA was comfortable and a good choice of food and drinks. During the flight a selection of beverages was available free of charge and the crew offered additional drinks several times. The snack was a little small for the business class price, only a sandwich and a piece of cake was served. The flight back was good also, but there were no business class seats - just economy class seating with free middle seat. The lounge in Tunis is not the most comfortable but it does its job. The crew was friendly. Only minus point here: no food due to problems at Tunis airport (we were informed at the lounge so we had some snacks there). All in all we had two good flights and would use Tunisair again.",Business,8

A nice customer service person went into our reservation and could see that we had been bumped but had no idea why. On the way back Delta had no record of our reservation but since we had proof they managed to squeeze us onto the plane after trying to get us to take one 2 hours later.

Onboard, crew was nice and service was ok, meal choice was chicken or beef and that was tasty.

Bags did arrive at Air rail-terminal on time, but it was not sure if our oversized luggage would arrive on time. Lost and found was kind to fill up a form, before our LH train leaves. Lost and found did a nice and very good job and they were very good and helpful.

It was also nice to be offered a pre flight beverage, chose white wine served in a plastic cup. The first class bulkhead seats we had were spacious. Embraer 175s do not have ovens so lunch was a cold chicken orzo salad with an appetizer and desert served all at once. Many reviews indicate that crew was either rude or inattentive but my experience wasn't like that. The drinks were kept filled during the flight, food ample and tasty and the flight attendants were upbeat and social. Boarding in LAX was a mess as the gate was in the corner and no one listens when they tell you they board by zone. Once on board a pre flight beverage was offered and after take off they served dinner. On the LAX to SEA route, Delta has partnered with Luvo as part of upgrading food service in first class. The wrap and accompaniments were fresh and delicious. Drinks flowed and attendants were offered snacks and checked on customer needs.

The lounge at Heathrow was very crowded. Afternoon Tea time so just sandwiches, cakes and soup available. Sandwiches were fresh and very nice. Plane as a 747 that had seen better times. The seat was clean but tired looking. The biggest let down was the screen that was blurry in comparison to the Bling Airways screen I had in economy. The main meal was really nice. Beef fillet that was tender and cooked. Side Salad full of flavour and Mediterranean starter that I wanted more of. The 2nd meal was ""afternoon tea"" of 3 finger sandwiches and a piece of chocolate rocky road. A real cream tea would have been better! Seat comfortable upright and in sleeping position. Got plenty of rest and sleep both ways. Coming back the lounge in Vancouver is above the gate. Just enough seats. Nice snacks. Another nice meal on board, spoilt by a dry bread roll. Breakfast was a big disappointment. Expecting a cooked English breakfast we got fruit in a plastic box followed by an egg and bacon muffin. I took one bight of the muffin and it mad me want to gag. Good crews on both legs. Bags came out priority so big plus to BA.

The breakfast served before arrival in Paris was only a little better - a limp omelette with a couple of pieces of vegetable. The entertainment system kept freezing. I watched 2 movies but never saw the end of either them! Having spent the previous few weeks travelling on Asian carriers around Asia and India I was struck by how far European Airlines have fallen behind in customer service and in-flight catering. On the connecting service to Edinburgh I was offered a biscuit! On a flight of similar length in India I was offered a hot meal. To end on a positive note both flights were very punctual.",Economy,3

Southwest came through and got us back to Providence, albeit two hours late. The terminal monitors in Detroit kept us well informed of delays and the Southwest app (although a bit slow in updating) did also. For the people who complain about the boarding methodology of Southwest, it is a bit strange for the uninitiated, but it works and has worked successfully for many years. If you insist on assigned seating, don’t fly Southwest - simple as that.  It is an airline that admittedly has its foibles, but even with that it is still an excellent product! .",Economy,9
