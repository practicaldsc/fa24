> We're in the final stretch! Some updates:
> - We have two review sessions: Monday 12/9 from 6:30-8:30PM and Tuesday 12/10 from 5-7PM. Both are in 1670 BBB and are recorded. Scroll down to see the content covered in each one.
> - If at least 85% of the class fills out both the internal [End-of-Semester Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfM0KHvq71kkyYHAKXHAD4Dk_mJx1P38o7PKhaN4U_xequ00Q/viewform) and the [Official Course Evaluations](https://umich.bluera.com/umich/) by Tuesday 12/10 at 11:59PM, we'll add 1% of extra credit to everyone's overall grade. **As of Sunday 12/8, we're only at ~60% completion!**
> - The deadline for the optional prediction competition in Homework 10 has been extended until Monday 12/9.
