        note: I wrote the "PCA TA Notes" above when I was a TA for a similar class; take a look if you're curious, and read <a href="https://ds100.org/course-notes/pca_2/pca_2.html">this</a> if you want to learn even more about PCA. Neither PCA nor softmax regression are in scope for the Final Exam.
